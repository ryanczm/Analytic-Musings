            <img src="images/me.JPG" height=250 id="limpeh">

            <p>Hi, my name is Ryan and I’m a Year 3 student at NUS Business School majoring in Finance & Analytics. I shall be learning in the general direction of finance, programming, mathematics and documenting my projects and experiences here. I thus
                am going to try and embark on a self-learning journey, which can be difficult learning topics without a formal education, but the key is to figure out how best to overcome that.</p>

            <p>I’m also trying to come up with a cognitive learning framework of sorts, in which we can distill the different types of cognitive “modes” of thinking to learn or interact with a particular field or subject. Hence, going on a learning journey
                allows me to “test” that framework, and see if it works! However, what if we could teach people to expand their set of “modes”. This idea involves <i>metacognition</i>, or being aware of one’s thought process, and one can derive the so
                called “ideal” thought process for a subject by observing the thought processes of experts or people skilled at that subject, and trying to reverse-engineer that thought process to <i>capture</i> it, then to test it yourself.</p>

            <section id="Website">
                <h2>Website:</h2>
                <p>The website is not as polished as I’d like, I need to add a mobile-friendly version with a proper media query (I jerry-rigged the CSS), and integrate more Javascript functionality, like a search bar. I started learning web development
                    for a week and a half at the time of writing, so it has been rushed, and the website is fairly static in nature. It is hosted on Github Pages. Design was inspired by Robert Martin's <a href="http://www.reasonabledeviations.com"> reasonabledeviations.com </a>whose
                    website design I found fantastic for a personal blog. He writes on quantitative finance and science.</p>

            <section id="Naming">
                <h2>Naming:</h2>
                <p>I have yet to come up with a creative name. In the meantime, I figured using my name as a domain is probably an appropriate until I come up with a name. </p>
            </section>

            <section id="Plans">
                <h2>Plans:</h2>
                <p>Apart from the introduction, the useful resources, and useful shortcuts, I plan to add some projects after I work on them. I’d have to work through the various courses and textbooks as collated in the useful resources post to be able to
                    complete them, which should take some time.
