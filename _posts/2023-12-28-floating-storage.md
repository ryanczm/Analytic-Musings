title: "Paper Replication: Crude Oil Contango Arbitrage & Floating Storage"
category: commodities

---
I analyze  Regli's - Crude Oil Contango Arbitrage and the Floating Storage Decision 2019 paper, which investigates and models historical floating storage arbitrage opportunities (GFC, 2008 and the Oil Glut, 2015) when the crude oil curve is in contango. Basically the idea is in supply-shock crises you are better off storing your crude for a long time. Something something freight rate term structure blah blah.

The paper is divided into several parts: it explains formulas for floating storage trade & the no-arbitrage condition, then simulates the profitability of floating storage from 2006-2018, and analyses excess profits over a FFA-hedged time-charter strategy (using the vessel for transport instead of storage).

# The Floating Storage Trade

A floating storage trade is a "cash-and-carry" trade to exploit the contango structure of the forward curve of crude. Intuitively, this makes sense: if contango is caused by oversupply of stocks in the short term, the market incentivizes participants to 'correct' the oversupply by storing stocks for future consumption. One buys a short term and shorts a long term future, receives and holds the commodity till delivery.

The authors state a similar equation to the past paper, with continuous compounding for the profit:

$$\pi = (F_{t}(1 - TRC) - e^{r(T-t)}(S_{t}(1 + TRC) + INS))w - e^{r(T-t)}(TC_{t}(T - t) + MGO_{t} + PC)$$

The authors go into more detail of the terms. The TRC term accounts for transaction costs from bid ask spreads. The funding cost is reflected in the exponential term projecting cash flows to time $T$. The authors use weekly one-year time charter rates by Clarkson for a 310,000 dwt VLCC tanker.

Assuming the agents fund the storage trade at LIBOR, they use $r$ as the discount factor, as a proxy. The authors note commodity traders use secured borrowing (via letters of credit for example) which would be at a discount to unsecured rates due to collateral. They plot summary statistics of their dataset:

The authors construct a trade of 1Y horizon from buying the 1M brent contract and selling the 13M Brent contract. They then calculate profits, from 2006-2018. The 13M-1M Brent future spread measures the contango:

This is also easily seen from a forward curve plot when the contango shape is visible in mid 2008:

Assuming a 1Y holding period, the authors plot the weekly PnL from storing 2 million barrels of Brent across time. From the chart, floating storage is profitable only in the end of 2008 and some time in 2015.

### Demand vs Supply Shocks & Holding Period Length

Interestingly, they vary the storage period, with 2M, 6M, 1Y, 18M and 2Y storages, via interpolating their time-charter rate data. This leads to a rather hard to read plot:

While difficult to see on the above plot, the authors note that profits with _shorter holding periods_ were higher than longer ones during the financial crisis, but the _reverse effect_ occured in the oil glut. They attribute this effect to the nature of the shock itself affecting time-charter term structure differently.

In the GFC, oil fell from a high of 133.88 in June 2008 to a low of 39.09 in February 2009. This was a demand shock: as a result of a recession with lower consumer, industrial, air travel and shipping activity. The supply of crude is inelastic in the short term. They argue there was low demand across time-charter term structure (flat and low). Since supply didn't decrease as much, there was less need for additional capacity in the form of floating storage. Coupled with the rapid drop in price, it would be better to store for a shorter term.

From reading, the oil glut was caused by the North American shale boom causing oversupply, China's economy slowing down, and the Saudi/OPEC bid to kill off shale by increasing output (the production costs of are shale high - requiring a high minimum price to be profitable). This was a supply shock. The authors argue the term structure for TCs was downward sloping as the increased supply led to an increase in demand for floating storage with inland capacity at its limits. Thus, only long term holding periods exploiting the far end of the TC curve would be profitable.

## The Floating Storage Decision

The authors then argue that a more accurate assessment involves looking at _excess profits_ over a FFA hedged time-charter strategy where the charterer:

1. Time-charters a vessel and pays the time-charter rate.
2. Employs it in the voyage-charter market and earns the voyage charter freight rate(s).
3. Hedges the voyage charter freight rates with FFAs.

 The formula for excess profit is given by adding an additional term to account for profit from using the ship for transport:

$$\pi^{Excess}_{t} = \pi - \max\{e^{r(T-t)}(T - t)(FFA_{t,T} - FR.Baltic_{t,T} - TC_{t,T} + FR_{t,T}), 0\} \geq 0$$

Where $FR$ is the averaged out daily voyage charter revenue. $FR.Baltic$ is the average of _time-charter equivalent settlement rates_ for Baltic Exchange FFAs. Voyage charter rates are paid at spot, so in theory, $FR.Baltic$ and $FR$ cancel out (assuming no basis risk from say, different routes or vessel characteristics).

Then, the charterer earns the _FFA TC_ basis: $FFA - TC$. This was tricky for me to rationalize, but the idea is that the charterer hedges his spot exposure from voyage-charter via a TCE FFA, not a voyage-charter FFA, which nets against the time-charter rate.

### The Ellefsen Paper

On a side note, this idea of _optionality_ is explored in Ellefsen's [_Commodity Market Modeling & Physical Trading Strategies_](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/61602/704383331-MIT.pdf) 2011 paper, in which the author formulates a model to decide on optimal routing for _cross Atlantic crude oil arbitrage with possibility of floating storage_.

He states this problem of _optimal stopping_ is akin to calculating the value of an _American option_, which gives the owner the right to exercise any time before it's expiry date. This was the original paper I wished to replicate, but was unable to do so (yet!) due the heavy focus on stochastic calculus/PDEs.


## Using AIS Data to Track Tankers in 2015



Returning back to the main paper, rather than analytically model the choice with American options, they use AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from MarineTraffic of all dirty tankers on time-charter from October 2014 to August 2016. AIS is a tracking system via radio transceivers that tracks location and other key information about a ship, for fleet tracking, maritime security, and other purposes.

The authors then manually categorize tankers on time-charter into _storage only_, _storage & voyage_ and _transport_. A tanker is assigned _storage & voyage_ if it has a draught above 15m (a laden tanker displaces more water) and a speed below 6 knots.
They then plug numbers into calculate $\pi^{Excess}_{t}$ for each tanker and plot the results above.


We can see it does look like positive excess profits over the alternative voyage-charter strategy still happens. Clearly, profits are to be made, and the question for firms is how to predict such opportunities, aka predicting contango term structure in advance.

## Conclusion

To conclude, this post analyzes Regli's _Crude Oil Contango Arbitrage and the Floating Storage Decision_ 2019 paper. While not actually drawing any novel conclusion, the paper has exposed me to a framework of modelling floating storage arbitrage decisions.

It has also made me more familiar with forward curve term structure and elementary freight concepts like using FFAs to hedge risk (even though no numbers were mentioned in the paper). I especially liked the part on using satellite data to classify ship behavior.
