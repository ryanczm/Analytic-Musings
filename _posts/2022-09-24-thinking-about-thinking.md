title: Thinking About Thinking (Metacognition)

In this post, I explore the notion that we can observe experts in different fields and distill their underlying patterns of thought via the right syntax in order to adapt the "optimal style of thought" for that field (e.g natural sciences, computation, humanities).
<!--more-->

A _field_ is just an area of study. My idea is that understanding complexity is about linking things together, but each field has different _things_, and each thing has it's own type of _link_. As we link things together, we can build a clearer visualisation in our head.

## The Right Words
I posit how to think about these _things_ and _links_ can be captured by invoking the right _word_ or _syntax_.

> We have just seen, through an example, how important words are in Mathematics. One can hardly believe how a well-chosen word can provide economy of thought.

Thus, by _observing_ experts in respective fields, like a scientist, mathematician, programmer, investor being interviewed,  and examining their _choice of words_, we can capture how they think. Sounds simple enough! 
## Fields

<p>I categorize fields (subjects of study) into three types: deterministic, semi-deterministic, and humanistic.</p>
<img src="{{ site.imageurl }}Metacognition/Page1B.png" height=350 class="center"> 

<p><b>Deterministic</b> fields are the sciences and their derived fields. Physics, mathematics, etc. These have fixed laws (of nature). </p>

<p><b>Semi-deterministic</b> fields just refers to computing: it has fixed laws that are modifiable by humans (e.g we make the laws via telling the computer what to do via programming).</p>

<p><b>Humanistic</b> fields refers to fields studying human behavior: economics, finance, history, politics, etc. The <i>laws</i> arise due to human behavior.</p>

I argue each field can be thought of in two ways: a <i>primal form</i>, involving linking things together as a <i>graph</i>, and a <i>dual</i> form, which is basically <i>visualising</i> something in your head. 

So, let's try to find the right words to express the _things_ and their _links_.

<h2>Deterministic Framework</h2>

<p>Example Fields: Mathematics, natural sciences, engineering.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental things: <i>concepts (abstraction)</i> and <i>physical objects (physical variable)</i>. They can be represented with words (or symbols):</p>
<p>They are linked via connections. These can be direct or latent. Direct connections are obvious. Latent ones are sudden inspirations between seemingly unrelated things. The idea is to build up a dense, well-connected network of things in your head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are moments where you <i>put something together</i> and realize this is how the story has to go.</p>

<p>Notice their choice of words: they imply connecting things together. What about the other type of <i>thing</i> aka measurements? </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Feynman is imagining a measurement (the jiggling) and showing how that interacts with another measurement (another bunch of atoms jiggling). </p>

# Semideterministic Framework

For semi-deterministic fields, this is pretty difficult. I believe the best way to approach computation is via _systems_. What is a system? A system consists of a bunch of systems. Or parts. The key skill, I believe is breaking down a system into the respective systems, and doing this in a recursive manner to unlock complexity. Parts interact with each other by passing inputs and output amongst another, being data. This area is tough because I think it's hard to quantify exactly the mental model needed compared to other frameworks, but I believe this is the most effective way.

The idea of _breaking a system down into more systems/parts_ and doing it _recursively_ is not _linear_, unlike the deterministic framework. It takes into account everything at once. That is the key distinction between the semideterministic framework and deterministic way of thinking. So here are some prompts:

* What system is this part a part of?
* What does this compose of? What can this be broken down into?
* What is going on under the hood?

Input → system (computation) → output. This is my core paradigm for understanding anything.

There's a relatively good understanding of <i>abstraction layers</i>. Atoms, silicon, transistors, logic gates, functional units, processing elements, instruction sets, languages - abstraction layers from the atom to the datacenter.

<h2>Humanistic Framework</h2>

These fields encompass finance, economics, history, etc. In here, the key node is a composite of a behavior, an entity/actor, and a view. We draw connections to build a _situation_ to other nodes. A cheap heuristic would be to ask _who_, _what_ and _why_.

An example is fundamental analysis. In this case, one tries to forecast how a _situation_ will play out, by constructing a graph of actors/behaviors, analyzing how a situation has evolved to a current point, then taking a view on how it will evolve into the future. This basically means trying to correctly predict human behavior in a low-dimensional fashion: so-and-so thinks this way, so he/she will do this. 

<blockquote>
<p>My framework is built on two propositions. The first is that in situations that have thinking <i>participants</i>, the participants’ <i>views</i> of the world never perfectly correspond to the actual state of affairs.
The second proposition is that these imperfect views can influence the situation to which they relate through the <i>actions</i> of the participants.</p>

<h2>Visualisation: Dual form</h2>

We have covered the primal form or words. Now for the dual form of visualising. How do we paint a picture/simulation in our head corresponding to the linked things?

For deterministic fields, we have to precisely visualise things. This means lengths, angles, distances matter.

For semideterministic fields, we visualise computations together. This means we only care about seeing how the inputs and outputs get produced or made or changed.

For humanistic fields, we visualise the network of actions of participants in a chain-reaction sort of manner.

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

Clearly, complexity or understanding it is about linking things together and having a good mental picture of them. But different discplines have different ways to approach this. By observing interviews of experts and their thought process, we can put the right words to them and try to adapt them so we can learn faster.
