In this post, I analyze  Alizadeh's Cost of Carry, Causality & Arbitrage between Oil Futures & Tanker Freight Markets 2003 paper, which investigates the existence of excess profits from transatlantic arbitrage by delivering Brent or Bonny  against the WTI futures contract at Cushing due to possible regional supply-demand imbalances.

<!-- Given my background as an Energy Analyst, it was quite surprising that my time there did not equip me with skills to understand commodity markets. -->
Mainly due to time constraints (did this in 2 days) I did not _replicate_ the paper _per se_, e.g getting the data, coding and evaluating the results. We will do that in due time.


The paper is divided into several parts: it first explains the cost-of-carry model for the WTI Futures Contract, then performs a VECM/cointegration/Granger causality analysis on WTI futures, Brent or Bonny spot, and freight rates data, then 'backtests' to calculate the arbitrage profit when the futures-physical spread divergences sufficiently.

# The Cost of Carry Model

WTI is a blend of crudes from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. The futures contract is traded at NYMEX/CME.

WTI futures are _physically deliverable_ into Cushing oil terminal. The catch is, the authors argue, that the contract specifications allow for not just domestic crudes, but _foreign crude_ to be delivered, at a quality discount or premium: 

The authors state (at time of publication), North Sea crudes (BFOE) and Bonny Light (Nigerian) settle at a _$30c/bbl_ discount & _$15c/bbl_ premium respectively to WTI (due to differences in gravity & sweetness). The deliverable quality rulebook by CME is [here](https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/2/200.pdf).

<!-- **WTI contract price chart or specification chart** -->

The authors state the (discrete compounding + linear) form of the formula (without convenience yield) relating spot to forward prices $S(t,T)$ and $F(t,T)$ as follows:

$$F_{WTI, t;T}=S_{WTI,t} * (1+C_{WTI, t;T}) + ST_{t;T} + TR + INS$$

Where $C$ is financing costs (interest), $ST$ storage costs, $TR$ is transportation costs (to delivery point) and $INS$ is insurance. If the forward curve is in enough contango and LHS > RHS, then traders can perform a [cash-and-carry storage trade]() to profit off the difference.

However, given possibility of delivering Brent or Bonny instead of WTI, one can buy sell WTI futures while buying spot Brent and shipping it from Sullom Voe (Brent delivery point) in the Shetland Islands to USA for delivery:

$$F_{WTI, t;T}=S_{BR,t} * (1+C_{BR, t;T}) + ST_{t;T} + TR + INS + 0.30$$

Relating spot Brent to WTI futures, and $TR$ is the corresponding freight rate and $PT$ is the pipeline tariff (from port to Cushing) and the 30c/bbl discount. This formula implies Brent/Bonny spot, WTI futures and the relevant freight rates are linked together _in theory_ as any long-term divergences will be exploited via the above arbitrage.

# Statistical Analysis

The authors pull the weekly close of WTI futures, Brent physical, Nigerian Bonny physical, 1M LIBOR rates from Jan 1993 to Aug 2001 (Datastream). For freight data the authors use weekly rates of Aframax Sullom Voe to Bayway (NSEA to USAC) and Suezmax Bonny to Philadephia (WAFR to USAC) in Worldscale, then converted to USD/bbl (Clarksons).

Looking at the [Baltic Exchange Website interactive map](https://www.balticexchange.com/en/data-services/routes.html) for dirty tanker routes (TD), we see this map:

<figcaption>While the interface is poor, the only two TD routes from West Africa are not direct to US Gulf.</figcaption>
</center>

I notice the exact routes stated by the authors in 2003 no longer exist on the Baltic website. For Brent, the closest routes are `TD7` (Aframax from North Sea to Continent) and `TD25` (Panamax from ARA to US Gulf). For Bonny, `TD20` (Suezmax from West Africa to UK continent). One assumes charterers use composite routes. Looking closely, there is no blue line from West Africa to the US in today's map.

The authors plot F1WTI (contract closest to expiry), Bonny and Brent to notice a close relationship. This was the _only_ chart in the paper.

They then perform a myriad of stationarity tests and a normality test on the logged prices/diffs series to verify that all series (futures, physical, freight) have the $I(1)$ property: the first difference is stationary, which is needed for cointegration tests. Then, they use the Johanssen cointegration test to derive cointegrating vectors, then plug them into a VECM model:

$$\Delta X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{p-1}\Gamma_i \Delta X_{t-i}+ \Pi X_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$

The $\Delta X_t$ is a first-differenced vector of WTI futures, Brent (or Bonny), and the corresponding freight rate. To fully understand the paper, we would need to _learn the logic of cointegration tests, VECM & Granger causality tests (I don't claim to yet)_ which would take _a lot_ of time. I will mark this as todo in the future.

</center>

The authors then state this important conclusion as below:

> The level of freight rates were not affected by the differential of WTI futures with either Brent or Bonny.

This was derived from interpreting the VECM model and GC tests. However, the line of reasoning is not clear as to how this conclusion was derived. While the authors conducted GC tests amongst futures, physical and freight, they did not test the futures-physical differential against the freight rate directly, which is confusing to me.
 
In theory, if the WTI futures-imported crude spread increases, Brent is cheaper to deliver, and traders would charter ships to bring imported crude to the USA to arbitrage, causing freight rates to increase. But clearly, this was not the case! A referee then pointed out tanker freight rates not responding to the spread movements could be due to _excess capacity_ (equilibrium is at the flat region of the J-shaped supply curve):

Nonetheless, the findings imply arbitrage opportunities exist. To investigate, the authors backtest the results of the Brent and Bonny trades across various parameters and tabulate the results. They use the spot price of Brent 3,4,5 weeks prior to maturity of the front WTI futures contract: delivery to Sullom Voe takes up to 2 weeks, loading takes 4 days, shipping takes 9, and discharging takes 4.

If one squints hard enough, the Bonny trades are significantly more profitable than the Brent trades, on a per-trade basis. They conclude Bonny is ideal for this trade. The dataset spans 1992-2001: 9 years. For Bonny, the average number of trade is ~20, thus ~2 trades a year. The average profit for Brent trades is 0.16m, while for Bonny it is ~0.59m. The authors mention the Brent trade uses an Aframax carrying `0.5mn` barrels while the Bonny trade uses Suezmax carrying `1mn` barrels per trade. Multiplying the Brent trade profit by 2, Bonny is more profitable by 0.17m per trade.

### Implications

We could first find data showing the proportions of different grades of crude delivered against at Cushing over time, the price spreads, ship movement data and freight rates. If the hypothesis were true, then:

* The number of tankers from Bonny to USAC should Granger cause the proportion of Bonny to WTI delivered.
* The spread of WTI-imported crude should Granger cause the freight rate in question.

We could then lag these two predictors and scatter it against their target values for different lags to see any patterns.

However, testing this in a modern context would require one to get updated routes and freight data given the routes mentioned in the paper no longer exist.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this post analyzes Alizadeh's _Cost of Carry, Causality & Arbitrage in Oil Futures & Tanker Freight Markets_ 2003 paper. While not being able to replicate the results due to data and time constraints, I will earmark this as a future project to try on out-of-sample data. This paper has exposed me to some concepts in commodity trading, showing how spatial arbitrage is done in theory.
