title: "Paper Replication: HFT in a Limit Order Book (Avellaneda & Stoikov)"
category: quant
excerpt: "In this post, I replicate Avellaneda and Stoikov's 2008 paper, which simulates a market-making strategy that sets quotes off an indifference price: an offset to the midprice based on inventory skew. I calibrate the model in Python to sample L2 data from LOBSTER & implement the paper - learning the basics of limit order books and the difficulties of simulating a HFT strat."
