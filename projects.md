This is a list of my growing projects and paper replications. The aim is to showcase to employers the interest and learn relevant skills/concepts in the field in a structured, organized fashion. In my case, _commodities, finance and data science_ (& their synergies). Replications must be done in Python:

* _Full_ - Manage to replicate most of the findings/results in the paper.
* _Partial_ - Replicate a modified/simplified version of the paper.
* _Commentary Only_ - Just a writeup with no code is possible.

Papers are subject to _concept constraints_ and _data constraints_. If concepts are tough, it takes longer, but can still be done. However, if data is not available publicly (e.g CRISPR/Compustat, LOBSTER, Bloomberg, Clarksons), then it is the main constraint.

1. Pick a paper with good citations and by reputable, well-known figures in the field.
2. Find out concept (what concepts are needed) and data constraints. 
3. Figure out where to learn the foundational concepts (e.g what textbooks).
4. Figure out what data is used and how to get it. If not available, use trial data and do partial replication.
5. Read the textbook(s)/materials and bombard ChatGPT with questions.
6. Slowly piece together the paper with the textbooks, connecting the dots.
7. Figure out how to replicate the code. Post on Github and blogpost.
