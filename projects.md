This is a list of paper replications (I started this in Dec 2023). The aim is to showcase to employers the interest and learn relevant skills/concepts in the field. In my case, _commodities, finance and data science_. Many papers use data from research databases or paywalled sources so we have to adapt with what data is publicly available.

I understand there is _public knowledge_ (textbooks, papers) and _proprietary knowledge_ (accessible only by working in a firm using that knowledge). Obviously, the latter is not possible for me to cover.
