            <h2>Progress:</h2>
            <p>Did this since the turn of 2021. Still ongoing..</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Progress:</h2>
            <p>So following the roadmap, I've covered some of linear algebra, single variable and multivariable calculus, discrete maths and introductory probability. The next step is to tackle Analysis (Real), which is the gateway to many other branches. In a way, if you play MMOs (like WoW for example), then the stuff I've covered is just the beginners zone (aka Elwynn Forest if you play as a human).</p>
            <p>The really exciting, cool parts of math are gated behind Analysis. Unfortunately, reading Tao's book is like swimming through an infinite, murky swamp of proofs (picture swimming through a really dense swamp) and this is very time consuming. I won't be done anytime soon. Having said that, the choice was Tao vs Abbott, and for me the way Tao writes is just way more elegant and exciting, like reading a storybook, so I went with Tao.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Learning points:</h2>
            <p>Again, it seems to be about the ability to <b>connect different concepts together</b>. Concepts can only be explained in terms of other concepts, and this follows till you reach "atomic" concepts,
                aka the basic axioms or building blocks. Some concepts cannot be
                'intuited' because they can only be explained by invoking other concepts, which in turn need to be explained in terms of other concepts. This seems to be the style of thinking of mathematics. The axiomatic, rigid way of connecting concepts
                to other concepts to form a framework, which suits understanding complex phenomena or ideas. Another key idea skill to me at least is learning to <b>comfortably interpret notation and what it represents</b>, and vice versa to see the story being told.
                Honestly, notation is a key roadblock to overcome, I feel like if you can smoothly "parse" notation, ideas flow alot easier. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>To do:</h2>
            <p>Finish Tao I and II.
            </p>
