            <h2>Progress:</h2>
            <p>Did this since the turn of 2021. Still ongoing..</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Review:</h2>
            <p>Went through Messer- Linear Algebra: sets, vector spaces, euclidean spaces, function spaces, subspaces, etc. Linear equations, Gauss-Jordan method. Dimensions, span, basis. Inner product spaces, norms, orthogonality. Matrices, Markov Chains.
                Linearity, compositions, change of basis, special subspaces (kernel, row, column). Determinants, cross product. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors. Skipped symmetry, diagonalization, systems of differential equations. Spivak- just some elementary
                notes. Basic properties of numbers, functions, limits, continuity, differentiation. Followed until proving integration & fundamental theorem of calculus, until which it got too complex for me (I believe this is a branch called real analysis).
                I decided to put it aside first and move over to Wassermann's statistics to make progress there. After Wassermann, the plan is to go through MIT OCWs 18.01 & 18.02.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Likes:</h2>
            <p>Never read a proper math textbook before, so Messer’s was the first. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Dislikes:</h2>
            <p>None</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Learning points:</h2>
            <p>Again, it seems to be about the ability to connect different concepts together, which was one thing I realized when reading this book. Concepts can only be explained in terms of other concepts, and this follows till you reach "atomic" concepts,
                aka the basic axioms or building blocks. Doing proofs seems to be about connecting different axioms. A concept like vector space for example, is simply explained by connecting it to the 8 axioms of vector space. Some concepts cannot be
                'intuited' because they can only be explained by invoking other concepts, which in turn need to be explained in terms of other concepts. This seems to be the style of thinking of mathematics. The axiomatic, rigid way of connecting concepts
                to other concepts to form a framework, which suits understanding complex phenomena or ideas. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>To do:</h2>
            <p>MIT OCWs 18.01 & 18.02, and actually go through (the very wordy) Spivak's proof of Integration and the FTC, then relook at the math roadmap.</p>
