            <h2>Progress:</h2>
            <p>Did this since the turn of 2021. Still ongoing..</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Review:</h2>
            <p>Went through Messer- Linear Algebra: sets, vector spaces, euclidean spaces, function spaces, subspaces, etc. Linear equations, Gauss-Jordan method. Dimensions, span, basis. Inner product spaces, norms, orthogonality. Matrices, Markov Chains.
                Linearity, compositions, change of basis, special subspaces (kernel, row, column). Determinants, cross product. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors. Skipped symmetry, diagonalization, systems of differential equations. Spivak- just some elementary
                notes. Basic properties of numbers, functions, limits, continuity, differentiation, and infinite sequences and series. Admittedly, I only tried like 1/2 questions per section, because they are ridiculously hard and the time tradeoff is not worth it now (since I'm not a math major anyway). It makes sense for me to cover more ground at the expense of less practice (in my context).</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Learning points:</h2>
            <p>Again, it seems to be about the ability to <b>connect different concepts together</b>. Concepts can only be explained in terms of other concepts, and this follows till you reach "atomic" concepts,
                aka the basic axioms or building blocks. Some concepts cannot be
                'intuited' because they can only be explained by invoking other concepts, which in turn need to be explained in terms of other concepts. This seems to be the style of thinking of mathematics. The axiomatic, rigid way of connecting concepts
                to other concepts to form a framework, which suits understanding complex phenomena or ideas. Another key idea skill to me at least is learning to <b>comfortably interpret notation and what it represents</b>, and vice versa to see the story being told.
                Honestly, notation is a key roadblock to overcome, I feel like if you can smoothly "parse" notation, ideas flow alot easier. Cool! </p>
            <br>
            <h2>To do:</h2>
            <p>See projects for the list, but Anton's LinAlg -->  Discrete Math / Set Theory / DE --> Graph Theory --> Something (Pray I even get that far past Discrete Math LOL). According to the roadmap, once you 
                clear the initial Linear Algebra + Calculus + Discrete Math hurdle it kind of opens up all kinds of options.
            </p>
