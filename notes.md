There is a large amount of alpha on social media with good domain-specific insights, in the form of podcasts, substacks, and books. For example, for commodity substacks/articles, we have _Ed Finley Richardson_, _Rory Johnston_, _Makai Research_, _Sparta_, etc. 

My aim is to slowly go through them and continuously learn, and have my notes here as an easily accessible resource for myself. As of May 2024, most of these are empty.
