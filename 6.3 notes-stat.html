            <p>Last updated: 7 Jan 2020 » Stat notes (rudimentary) Wassermann »
                <a href="files/stat.xlsx"><img src="images/logos/1. excel-4.svg" height=35> Link to notes </a>
            </p>

            <h2>Progress:</h2>
            <p>First week of 2021. Dropped halfway to do ML course</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Review:</h2>
            <p>Went through the first few chapters (Probability, Statistical (Bayesian) Inference). Didn't cover the remaining chapters (Statistical Decision Theory & Models) because school was starting & I was running out of time. Surprisingly heavy on
                notation.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Dislikes:</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, this book was quite tough as time progressed because Wassermann throws notation and theorems at you with little explanation. For example, when talking about common continuous distributions, the PDF & CDF of Gamma & Beta distributions
                is shown, with no explanation at all what they were used for or their intuition, and thus I had to search online for more answers on their meaning. After a while I realized the stats were getting too advanced so I dropped it halfway and
                went to do some ML courses because of time constraints..
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>To do:</h2>
            <p>Probably find another better-explained statistics textbook to go through next time. >:(</p>
