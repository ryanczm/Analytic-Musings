            <p><i>(All notes taken in Excel).</i> Right now, I have attempted to follow a formalized structure for note taking in excel (including idiosyncratic things like font styles, colors, and a very hierarchical style of writing out the table of contents of a book in a proper format
                before attempting it, with emphasis on organized structure).</p>
                <p>This is of course to facilitate learning, but things need to be very, very structured, so you know exactly where a section or subsection stands in relation to the overall structure of a book. I prefer doing notes in Excel because of how structured you can make the notes, yet contain them all very compactly in a single workbook. Of course, for effective speed, keyboard shortcuts help.
                 </p>

                        This is just to help keep my progress as organized as possible. I divide the ML notes into 4 categories: TS, NLP, CL (classical), and DL. Within DL there are some subcategories: CL (classical), CV, GN, RL. I haven't started planning the DL books yet. Most of the notes are actually empty (apart from table of contents of the books). My style is to write out the table of contents in Excel form, I find it helps for organization.

                        Some rudimentary notes from my introduction to the books of <i>Nisham's EOCS</i>, <i>Cormen's Data Structures and Algorithms</i> and <i>Abelson/Sussman's SICP</i>. Basically the very meta programming books, which are very complex and I've only just started. Because of how complex they are, I've moved on to do other stuff first, then come back to this.

                        Statistics. I've put stats aside to do other stuff, but the plan is to read the following books. For probability and statistics: <i>Blitzstein</i>, <i>Wackerly</i>. For regression models: <i>Draper</i>. For GLMs and Linear Models: <i>Agresti</i>. Then, I want to try Bayesian statistics, namely <i>Gelman</i> and <i>McElreath</i>. I will come back to this after doing some math. Gelman was too dense, so I believe McElreath is less mathematical and more verbose.

                        Notes. Mostly calculus, linear algebra, abit of discrete math, some graph theory, and now my goal is to attempt Analysis. Right now, the plan in the medium term, is to cover Tao I and II (Analysis), Zill (DE's), Axler (Lin Alg). Then, I can try look into functional and complex analysis. However, analysis itself is already proving to be very, very tough and slow progress.
