I'm Ryan. I graduated from NUS studying Business Analytics & Finance. I'm interested in commodities, data science & finance. I like learning and 
[meta-learning]({{ site.url }}/2022/09/24/thinking-about-thinking/) (improving my learning systems).

I enjoy all things data - cleaning, building, analyzing, modelling and using it to derive insights, be it in a quantitative or qualitative fashion. My motto is:

<p class="message" style="text-align: center;">
<i>Always learning. Always improving.</i>
</p>

Outside of work, I enjoy sports - floorball (I play competitively in SG's div 2) and football (recreationally).
