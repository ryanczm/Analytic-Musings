I'm Ryan. I graduated from NUS studying Business Analytics & Finance. I'm interested in quantitative and data analytics roles in the finance and commodities sector. I like learning and 
[meta-learning](_posts/2022-09-24-thinking-about-thinking.md) (improving my learning systems). I enjoy analyzing data & crunching numbers, using statistical tools and models to uncover insights. Python and SQL are my preferred languages.

I regret not choosing a pure STEM subject (mathematics/physics) as my degree, but given this context, it is apt to introduce my motto below:

<p class="message" style="text-align: center;">
Always learning. Always improving.

Outside of work, I enjoy sports - floorball (I play competitively in SG's div 2) and football (recreationally). I have been branching out my interests to learn dance - Kizomba and Bachata.
