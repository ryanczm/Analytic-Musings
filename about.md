I'm Ryan. I graduated from NUS studying Business Analytics & Finance. I'm interested in quantitative and data analytics roles in the finance and commodities sector. I like learning and 
[meta-learning](_posts/2022-09-24-thinking-about-thinking.md) (improving my learning systems).

I enjoy all things data - cleaning, building, analyzing, modelling. My motto is to always keep learning and improving.

Always learning. Always improving.

Outside of work, I enjoy sports - floorball (I play competitively in SG's div 2) and football (recreationally). I have been branching out my interests to learn dance - Kizomba and Bachata.
