## Plan

* Learning Fundamental Analysis
    * I need to learn _fundamental analysis_ for commodities. A key skill that commodity trading firms look for in analysts.
    * The skill of analyzing whats going in the markets in a discretionary fashion.
    * I have no work experience in this. I have to 'bootstrap' it from nothing - figure it out myself without work experience.
* The Plan
    * Commodity Twitter has lots of analysts who tweet out their views on how markets evolve by looking at market fundamentals, or plays.
    * We will systematically gather interesting Twitter threads, then do a writeup on selected ones.
* The Desired Result
    * In this process, we will learn how they think in terms of fundamental analysis. We will have some projects or articles analyzing plays.
    * Then, we put on resume to improve chances of landing/impressing in a commods trading analyst interview.
