            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary over time, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and fundamental data of the target when it was bought out.
                    However, when drafting this, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics, measuring performance at the
                    fund level instead. Unfortunately, the data is not available to non-institutions. </li>
                <li>Assessing the validity of Equity Research price targets (Again, data exclusivity is the problem)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>

            <p>Last update - <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>31<sup>th</sup> March 2021</b> (I have been unfortunately) or maybe not so, sacrificing my grades by reading these books instead of my coursework in my spare time, and now I just kind of do bare bones revision for tests. Can't say I'm not enjoying myself though <i>:P</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elements of Computing Systems (EOCS - Nisham)</b> - Bottom up approach. Went through at moderate pace but skipped actually building the virtual computer (which is the tough part). I just needed the intuition for now. Stopped at Compilers 1: Code generation. Should redo in the future, when there is time. Less a black box, maybe a grey box. Having said that, this book is insanely hard and extremely dense. For some books, you could achieve understanding with infinite time given your current abilities. But with other books (like this one), you just feel that even with infinite time with your current cognitive abilities you wouldn't be able to understand it unless you upgraded your thinking somehow. I'd have to relook at this again and think about how to approach it.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networks (Kurose and Ross)</b> - Top down approach. Only went through application layer and a bit of transport layer, then diverted to Cormen and Gould. </li>
                <li><b>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen- CLRS)</b> - Recently started. Another insanely hard and ridiculously dense book (but definitely not as hard as EOCS for sure) </li>
                <li><i>Elementary Linear Algebra (Anton)</i> - Relook because Messer's was very messy because it was a super low-res scanned version, which didn't help. Done.</li>
                <li><i>Discrete Math Structures book</i> (Kolman/Busby/Ross or Susanna) - Discrete math. Just for exposure. Only did set theory and logic sections.</li>
                <li><i>Set Theory book or Naive Set Theory (Halmos)</i> - Set Theory and Logic, just for exposure. Yet to attempt, and no real need to learn yet.</li>
                <li><i>Graph Theory book (Gould)</i> - Graph Theory. Started two days ago, alternating between this and Cormen. At 15-20%. Really interesting and cool. Added bonus that you can actually visualize graphs, and that graphs are isomorphic w.r.t geometry, so you don't need to worry about the distances or angles of graphs being accurate in your visualization.</li>
                <li><i>Multivariable (Hubbard's vector calculus)</i> &#8594; Differential Equations (Chapman/Hall or Tenebaum/Pollard) - Having started on Hubbards book, I don't plan to finish it, but it is extremely rigorous, yet well written but definitely not as insane as Spivak. This is a great balance.</li>
                <li><i>Bayesian Statistics (Hoff, Gelman)</i> - Hoff's <i>First Course in Statistical Methods</i> and <i>Gelman's Bayesian data analysis</i>, with more emphasis on the former for intuition since the latter is apparently a reference manual style book. </li>
                <li>Flask/Basic Dashboard web app stuff.</li>
                <li>Virtualization/container Docker/Kubernetes (Need to find where and how to learn this)</li>
                <li>Distributed/Parallel computing stuff (Spark, Hadoop, Scala) (Need to find where and how to learn this)</li>
                <li>Time series forecasting books (Hyndman, Brownlee, Shumway and Stoffer ??? Definitely not Hamilton. And SUNY's Coursera on TS.)</li>
                <li>NLP (Books like Jurafsky, but need to find some courses)</li>
                <li>AWS stuff (Just try and learn about the basics) - (Not too sure where to learn - what book or online course?) </li>
                <li>JS and JS framework (React or similar)</li>                
                <li>Try to learn some basics of a lower level language like C or C++ (Again, not too sure the best way of doing this, but it is a long way down the list so I won't be getting here soon, probably reading EOCS would help first) </li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
