            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary over time, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and fundamental data of the target when it was bought out.
                    However, when drafting this, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics, measuring performance at the
                    fund level instead. Unfortunately, the data is not available to non-institutions. </li>
                <li>Assessing the validity of Equity Research price targets (Again, data exclusivity is the problem)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>

            <p>Last update - <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>21<sup>st</sup> April 2021</b> - I have one exam left on the <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>5<sup>th</sup> of May</b>, and I am forgoing revision till the last 3 days to get a head start on the learning phase of stuff here. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elements of Computing Systems (EOCS - Nisham)</b> - Bottom up approach. Went through at moderate pace but skipped actually building the virtual computer (which is the tough part). I just needed the intuition for now. Stopped halfway. This book is insanely hard and extremely dense. Need to relook at this again. I am currently starting on books <b>CS</b> and <b>SICP</b> first.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networks (Kurose and Ross)</b> - Top down approach. Only went through application layer and a bit of transport layer, then diverted to Cormen and Gould. </li>
                <li><b>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen- CLRS)</b> - Recently started. Another insanely hard and ridiculously dense book (but definitely not as hard as EOCS for sure) </li>
                <li><b>Misc CS Books to read</b> - <i>Guttag's Introduction to Computer Programming with Python</i>, <i><b>Computer Systems by O'Halloran/Bryant</b></i> and <i><b>SICP (Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs) by Sussman/Abelson</b></i></li>
                <li><i>Elementary Linear Algebra (Anton)</i> - Relook because Messer's was very messy because it was a super low-res scanned version, which didn't help. Done.</li>
                <li><i>Discrete Math Structures book</i> (Kolman/Busby/Ross or Susanna) - Discrete math. Just for exposure. Only did set theory and logic sections.</li>
                <li><i>Set Theory book or Naive Set Theory (Halmos)</i> - Set Theory and Logic, just for exposure. Yet to attempt, and no real need to learn yet.</li>
                <li><i>Graph Theory book (Gould)</i> - Graph Theory. Meh.</li>
                <li><i>Mathematical Proofs</i> - Chartrand. I have always struggled with proofs, so I need to try and look at this.</li>
                <li><i>Multivariable (Hubbard's vector calculus)</i> &#8594; Differential Equations (Simmons)) - Having started on Hubbards book, I don't plan to finish it, it is rigorous and verbose but some of it is way too advanced for me.</li>
                <li><i>Analysis</i> - So I just had a look at Abbott's <i>Introduction to Analysis</i> and Tao's <i>Analysis I/II</i> - Probably going to be a very tough uphill climb from here on - I will probably set aside some time in the future to have a look through, but this will probably be the main roadblock for now, given that real analysis is the "gateway" to the more intermediate branches, according to the roadmap. <i>Edit:</i> Okay, maybe it isn't so bad, it seems just extremely rigorous, and highly time consuming. And I find proving very tough. Anyway, the goal is to gain enough mathematical maturity to take a shot at <i>Kreyszig's Introduction to Functional Analysis</i> and other functional analysis texts. </li>
                <li><i>Non-Bayesian Statistics</i> - non-Bayesian & non-Wassermann (because that guy's book had 0 explanation) to go over in due time. So far I've found - for probability theory - <i> Jayne's The Logic of Science</i>, <i>Blitzstein and Hwang's Introduction to Probability</i>, distributions - <i>Thomopoulous' Probability Distributions</i> and <i>Hastings/Peacock - Statistical Distributions</i>, linear models - (<i>Rencher/Schaalje, Gellman/Hill, Neter/Li)</i></li>
                <li><i>Bayesian Statistics (Hoff, Gelman)</i> - Hoff's <i>First Course in Statistical Methods</i> and <i>Gelman's Bayesian data analysis</i>, with more emphasis on the former for intuition since the latter is apparently a reference manual style book. </li>
                <li>Time series books (Hyndman, Brownlee, Shumway and Stoffer, Hamilton - too difficult) And SUNY's Coursera on TS.</li>
                <li><i>Python best practices</i>- I realized  I didn't have any experience on how libraries and packages are actually made, and best practices for writing Python code. So I found this book - <i>Hitchhikers Guide to Python</i> which covers that.</li>
                <li>Flask/Basic Dashboard web app stuff.</li>
                <li>Virtualization/container Docker/Kubernetes (Need to find where and how to learn this)</li>
                <li>Distributed/Parallel computing stuff (Spark, Hadoop, Scala) (Need to find where and how to learn this)</li>
                <li>NLP (Books like Jurafsky, but need to find some courses)</li>
                <li>AWS stuff (Just try and learn about the basics) - (Not too sure where to learn - what book or online course?) </li>
                <li>JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks/libraries, to gain proficiency to add some extra functionality to my website.</li>                
                <li>Try to learn some basics of a lower level language like C or C++ (Again, not too sure the best way of doing this, but it is a long way down the list so I won't be getting here soon, probably reading EOCS would help first) </li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
