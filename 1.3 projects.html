            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and target fundamental data.
                    However, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics.
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>

            <p>Last update - <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>7<sup>th</sup> June 2021</b> - This is a list of stuff to learn, for the long term, for bookkeeping. The plan is to structure a pseudo-syllabus consisting of textbooks for each topic, then allocate time (blocks of ~5 days per topic) Within each topic are the subtopics consisting of books. 
            The goal is to spread time evenly and not overly focus on one topic. The strategy is not completion (which is impossible), but to sample from each topic and chug along at a steady pace, switching topics once the window is up, <i>ad infinitum</i>. This post is just to keep track, and should keep me busy for a long time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elements of Computing Systems (EOCS - Nisham)</b> - Bottom up approach. I just needed the intuition for now. For these books, I plan to come back to them in the long term, since they are extremely tough and dense, I couldn't understand much.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networks (Kurose and Ross)</b> - Top down approach. </li>
                <li><b>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen- CLRS)</b> - Again, to come back to this after all the other stuff (math/stats/ML/other CS stuff) </li>
                <li><b>Misc CS Books to read</b> - <i><b>Computer Systems by O'Halloran/Bryant</b></i>, <i><b>SICP by Sussman/Abelson</b></i> and some misc books on design <i>(Ousterhout, Martin, Hunt, Robson)</i>. Unfortunately, these books are written in languages I am not familiar with (C and Java mainly), so their implied prerequisite is some familiarity of said languages first, which I did put as an objective below. So I have to go and try that.</li>
                <li><b>Linear Algebra</b> - To attempt <i>Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right</i> (proper book), having read <i>Anton</i> which was an introductory text.</li>
                <li><i>Graph Theory book (Gould)</i> - Graph Theory. I read the start and went to do other stuff.</li>
                <li><i>Mathematical Proofs</i> - Chartrand. I have always struggled with proofs, so I need to try and look at this.</li>
                <li> <b>Differential Equations </b> - My goal is to read <i>Zill</i>.</li>
                <li><i><b>Analysis</b></i> - Tao's <i>Analysis I/II</i> - The main roadblock for now, given that real analysis is the gateway to the more intermediate branches. I find proving very tough. Anyway, the goal is to gain enough mathematical maturity to attempt and gain exposure to Functional analysis (<i>Kreyszig</i>) and Complex analysis (<i>Churchill</i>). Once I do that I will go back to basics and attempt some proofs from the beginning, since I have only a surface level understanding of proofs (i.e never tried to prove things myself). However I don't see myself getting to this point for a long while (I'd say half a year, at least). </li>
                <li><i><b>Statistics</b></i> - <b>Probability and statistics:</b> <i>Blitzstein's Introduction to Probability</i>, <i>Wackerly's Mathematical Statistics with Applications</i>, <i>Krishnamoorthy's Statistical Distributions</i>, <b>for regression models:</b> <i>Draper's Applied Regression Analysis</i>, <b>for GLMs</b>: <i>Agresti's Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models</i>. I wouldn't be able to understand probability at a measure-theoretic level until I have the requisite Analysis understanding, but from what I read online, measure-theoretic probability is abit overkill for the layman. Of course, I hope to get there in due time.</li>
                <li><i><b>Bayesian Statistics</b></i> - To read <i>Gelman's BDA</i>,<i>McElreath's Statistical Rethinking</i>, <i>Cameron</i> and <i>Martin</i>.</li>
                <li><i><b>Python stuff</b></i> - <i>Reitz's Hitchhikers Guide to Python</i>, <i>Beazley's Python Cookbook</i> and <i>Danjou's Serious Python</i> for software-design aspects: library construction, OOP design, testing/debugging, network programming, concurrency - all of these concepts which I am not as familiar with as I'd like yet.</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff - <i>Time series</i></b> books (<i>Nielsen</i>, <i>Brownlee</i>, <i>Stoffer</i>, <i>Hamilton</i> - too difficult). The reviews on Stoffer are generally quite bad, but I can't seem to find a good alternative. :(</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff - <i>NLP</i></b> books - <i>Loper (NTLK book), </i><i>Lane (NLPIA)</i>, <i>Jurafsky (bible)</i>, <i>Ravichandran (BERT/transformers)</i>, <i>Rothman (BERT/transformers)</i>.</li>
                <li><b>DE stuff - Data engineering.</b> I've managed to structure an order of learning and found some books/courses, starting with the general <i>Kleppmann's Designing Data Intensive Applications</i>, <i>Weber's Data Science in Production</i>, then books on Flask <i>(Grinberg)</i>, AWS <i>(Wittig)</i>, Docker <i>(Cook)</i>, Airflow <i>(Ruiter)</i>, Kafka <i>(Bejeck)</i>, Spark <i> (Damji) </i>respectively. <b>Edit</b>: Unfortunately, I have realized Bash scripting (<i>Shotts</i>) is a necessary pre-req, so I will do this one first.</li>
                <li><b>Frontend</b> - JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks/libraries. JS (Simpson), JS (Flanagan), Wieruch (React), Casciaro (Node), Freeman (Angular) I've managed to scrape together some books, but this is a long way down the road. This list is very rudimentary and I feel like it's missing stuff. I also feel like this is one of the areas where  doing > learning, but still. Books are a static source of learning and perhaps YouTube videos/doing stuff will work better.</li>                
                <li> Backend - Exposure to lower level language (Long way down the list so I won't be getting here soon, and low priority). Anyway for bookkeeping: Java (Schildt/Horstmann), C++ (Savitch/Lippmann). </li>
                <li><b>Science stuff:</b> I've put together the structure/syllabus of sorts of ~4-7 textbooks each for undergraduate Physics, Chemistry, and Biology from Susan Fowler's website and MIT OCW respectively.</li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
