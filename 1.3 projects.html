            <h1 class="page-title">Projects/Goals</h1>

            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary over time, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and fundamental data of the target when it was bought out.
                    However, when drafting this, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics, measuring performance at the
                    fund level instead. Unfortunately, the data is not available to non-institutions. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>

            <p>Last update - <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>5<sup>th</sup> May 2021</b> - My exams have finished, so I have planned out a ~1 month schedule to draw from the topics below (and some others). The plan is to first structure a pseudo-syllabus consisting of textbooks for each topic, then allocate time as evenly as possible (so ~5 days per topic) to work through the books and learn in a structured manner. Within each topic are the respective subtopics, and within these subtopics are the books.
            The goal is spread time evenly and not overly focus on one topic at the expense of the others. I'll be doing this for the time period until my internship starts. You can catch me at UTown SRC, which is very empty (thankfully).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elements of Computing Systems (EOCS - Nisham)</b> - Bottom up approach. Went through at moderate pace but skipped actually building the virtual computer (which is the tough part). I just needed the intuition for now. Stopped halfway. This book is insanely hard and extremely dense. Need to relook at this again. I am currently starting on books <b>CS</b> and <b>SICP</b> first.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networks (Kurose and Ross)</b> - Top down approach. Only went through application layer and a bit of transport layer, then diverted to Cormen and Gould. </li>
                <li><b>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen- CLRS)</b> - Recently started. Another insanely hard and ridiculously dense book (but definitely not as hard as EOCS for sure) </li>
                <li><b>Misc CS Books to read</b> - <i>Guttag's Introduction to Computer Programming with Python</i>, <i><b>Computer Systems by O'Halloran/Bryant</b></i> and <i><b>SICP (Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs) by Sussman/Abelson</b></i></li>
                <li><i>Elementary Linear Algebra (Anton)</i> - Relook because Messer's was very messy because it was a super low-res scanned version, which didn't help. Done.</li>
                <li><i>Discrete Math Structures book</i> (Kolman/Busby/Ross or Susanna) - Discrete math. Just for exposure. Only did set theory and logic sections.</li>
                <li><i>Set Theory book or Naive Set Theory (Halmos)</i> - Set Theory and Logic, just for exposure. Yet to attempt, and no real need to learn yet.</li>
                <li><i>Graph Theory book (Gould)</i> - Graph Theory. Meh.</li>
                <li><i>Mathematical Proofs</i> - Chartrand. I have always struggled with proofs, so I need to try and look at this.</li>
                <li><i>Multivariable (Hubbard's vector calculus)</i> &#8594; Differential Equations (Simmons)) - Having started on Hubbards book, I don't plan to finish it, it is rigorous and verbose but some of it is way too advanced for me.</li>
                <li><i><b>Analysis</b></i> - So I just had a look at Abbott's <i>Introduction to Analysis</i> and Tao's <i>Analysis I/II</i> - Probably going to be a very tough uphill climb from here on - I will probably set aside some time in the future to have a look through, but this will probably be the main roadblock for now, given that real analysis is the "gateway" to the more intermediate branches, according to the roadmap. <i>Edit:</i> Okay, maybe it isn't so bad, it seems just extremely rigorous, and highly time consuming. And I find proving very tough. Anyway, the goal is to gain enough mathematical maturity to take a shot at <i>Kreyszig's Introduction to Functional Analysis</i> and other branches of math. I have come to the realization (while reading the aforementioned texts); that the sheer volume of proofs means that if I were to actually try to prove them myself, I would have no time to do anything else. So, I shall just "accept" the proofs for what they are, until the point in time where I have time to try the proofs, which is probably never. </li>
                <li><i><b>Statistics</b></i> - The plan is to read the following books (partial readings of certain parts): <b>For probability and statistics:</b> <i>Blitzstein's Introduction to Probability</i>, <i>Wackerly's Mathematical Statistics with Applications</i>, <b>for regression models:</b> <i>Draper's Applied Regression Analysis</i>, <b>for GLMs</b>: <i>Agresti's Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models</i>. I wouldn't be able to understand probability at a measure-theoretic level until I have the requisite Analysis understanding, but from what I read online, measure-theoretic probability is abit overkill for the layman. Of course, I hope to get there in due time.</li>
                <li><i><b>Bayesian Statistics (Gelman)</b></i> - <i>Gelman's Bayesian data analysis</i>. </li>
                <li><i><b>Python stuff</b></i>- <i>Reitz's Hitchhikers Guide to Python</i>, <i>Beazley's Python Cookbook</i> and <i>Danjou's Serious Python</i>for software-design aspects: library construction, OOP design, testing/debugging, network programming, concurrency - all of these concepts which I am not as familiar with as I'd like yet.</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff: <i>Time series</i></b> books (<i>Nielsen</i>, <i>Brownlee</i>, <i>Shumway and Stoffer</i>, <i>Hamilton</i> - too difficult) And SUNY's Coursera on TS.</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff: <i>NLP</i></b> books - <i>Loper (NTLK book), </i><i>Lane (NLPIA)</i>, <i>Jurafsky (bible)</i>, <i>Ravichandran (BERT/transformers)</i>, <i>Rothman</i>.</li>
                <li><b>DE stuff: Data engineering.</b> I've managed to structure an order of learning and found some books/courses, starting with the general <i>Kleppmann's Designing Data Intensive Applications</i>, <i>Weber's Data Science in Production</i>, then books on Flask <i>(Grinberg)</i>, AWS <i>(Wittig)</i>, Docker <i>(Cook)</i> and Spark <i>(Damji)</i>respectively.</li>
                <li>JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks/libraries, to gain proficiency to add some extra functionality to my website. I've managed to scrape together some books, but this is a long way down the road.</li>                
                <li>Try to learn some basics of a lower level language like C or C++ (Again, not too sure the best way of doing this, but it is a long way down the list so I won't be getting here soon, probably reading EOCS would help first) </li>
                <li>Science stuff: I've put together the structure/syllabus of sorts of ~4-7 textbooks each for undergraduate Physics, Chemistry, and Biology from Susan Fowler's website and MIT OCW respectively.</li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
