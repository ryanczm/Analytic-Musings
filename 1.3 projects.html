            <h1 class="page-title">Projects/Goals</h1>

            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and target fundamental data.
                    However, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics.
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>

            <p>Last update - <b style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif";>11<sup>th</sup> July 2021</b> - This is a list of stuff to learn, for the long term, for bookkeeping. The plan is to structure a pseudo-syllabus consisting of textbooks for each topic, then allocate time (blocks of ~5 days per topic) Within each topic are the subtopics consisting of books. 
            The goal is to spread time evenly and not overly focus on one topic. The strategy is not completion (which is impossible), but to sample from each topic and chug along at a steady pace, switching topics once the window is up, <i>ad infinitum</i>. This post is just to keep track, and should keep me busy for a long time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Computer Architecture books</b> - <i>Tannenbaum</i> → <i>Ledin</i> → <i>Hennessy</i>. Prerequisite seems to be introductory low-level language (e.g C), so I will do that first. Scrapped EOCS in favour of these.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networking books</b> - <i>Tannenbaum</i>, <i>Kurose</i>. </li>
                <li><b>Software design/best practices books</b> - <i>Abelson (SICP)</i>, <i>Ousterhout</i>, <i>Martin</i>, <i>Hunt</i>, <i>Robson</i>. The prerequisites seem to be introductory C and Java, so in order to understand these, I have to learn that first.</li>
                <li><b>Theoretical CS books</b> - <i>CLRS</i>, <i>Moore</i>, <i>Hopcroft</i>, <i>Sipser</i>, <i>Arora</i>.</li>
                <li><b>Linear Algebra/Calculus</b> - To attempt <i>Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right</i> and <i>Hubbard's Vector Calculus</i>(I've only attempted the start of both of these so far). This would be the foundation for the ML/DL books below.</li>
                <li><i>Graph Theory</i> - <i>Gould</i></li>
                <li><i>Mathematical Proofs</i> - Chartrand. I have always struggled with proofs, so I need to try and look at this.</li>
                <li> <b>Differential Equations </b> - To read <i>Zill</i> and <i>Simon's</i>.</li>
                <li><i><b>Analysis</b></i> - Tao's <i>Analysis I/II</i>, Axler's <i>MIRA</i> - The main roadblock for now and the gateway to intermediate mathematics. Anyway, the goal is to gain enough mathematical maturity to learn introductionry Functional (<i>Kreyszig</i>) and Complex analysis (<i>Churchill</i>). Once I do that I will go back to basics and attempt some proofs from the beginning, since I have only a surface level understanding of proofs (i.e never tried to prove things myself). Don't see myself getting to this point for a long while. </li>
                <li><i><b>Statistics</b></i> - <b>Probability and statistics:</b> <i>Blitzstein's Introduction to Probability</i>, <i>Wackerly's Mathematical Statistics with Applications</i>, <i>Krishnamoorthy's Statistical Distributions</i>, <b>for regression models:</b> <i>Draper's Applied Regression Analysis</i>, <b>for GLMs</b>: <i>Agresti's Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models</i>. </li>
                <li><i><b>Bayesian Statistics</b></i> - <i>Gelman</i>,<i>McElreath</i>, <i>Cameron</i> and <i>Martin</i>.</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff - <i>Time series</i></b> books (<i>Lazzeri</i>, <i>Brownlee</i>, <i>Korstanje</i>, <i>Stoffer/Montgomery</i>, <i>Koopman</i>). Once I have done that, I can read <i>Tsay</i>. However this is going to take a very long while to make progress in at all.</li>
                <li><b>ML stuff - <i>NLP</i></b> books - <i>Loper (NTLK book), </i><i>Lane (NLPIA)</i>, <i>Jurafsky (bible)</i>, <i>Ravichandran (transformers)</i>, <i>Rothman (transformers)</i>. I've only started on <i>Jurafsky</i> so far.</li>
                <li><b>Classical ML stuff</b> - Selected chapters from <i>ESL</i>, <i>Bishop</i> and <i>Murphy</i>. For DL, <i>Bengio</i>, <i>Zhang</i>. However for <i>Bengio</i> a sturdy foundation in linear algebra and vector Calculus, background in information theory and numerical analysis is required. So this means I have to properly attempt <i>Axler</i> and <i>Hubbard</i>, which I have not yet done so due to time constraints. Of course, I could just go ahead and focus on the coding aspect instead of the theory aspect. </li>
                <li><b>DE stuff - Data engineering.</b> I've managed to structure an order of learning and found some books/courses, starting with the general <i>Kleppmann's Designing Data Intensive Applications</i>, <i>Weber's Data Science in Production</i>, then books on Flask <i>(Grinberg)</i>, AWS <i>(Wittig)</i>, Docker <i>(Cook)</i>, Airflow <i>(Ruiter)</i>, Kafka <i>(Bejeck)</i>, Spark <i> (Damji) </i>respectively. <b>Edit</b>: Unfortunately, I have realized Bash scripting (<i>Shotts</i>) is a necessary pre-req, so I will do this one first.</li>
                <li><b>Frontend</b> - JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks/libraries. JS (<i>Simpson</i>), JS (<i>Flanagan</i>), Wieruch (<i>React</i>), Casciaro (<i>Node</i>), Freeman (<i>Angular</i>) I've managed to scrape together some books, but this is a long way down the road. This list is very rudimentary and I feel like it's missing stuff. I also feel like this is one of the areas where  doing > learning, but still. Books are a static source of learning and perhaps YouTube videos/doing stuff will work better.</li>                
                <li> <b>Backend</b> - Some introduction to lower level languages, are prerequisites for the above CS books which I really want to read. C (<i>Seacord</i>, <i>Prata</i>), Java (<i>Schildt, Horstmann</i>), C++ (<i>Prata</i>, Lippmann</i>). It's not that I want to learn these languages to use them, but rather just so I can understand the above CS books. </li>
                <li><b>Science stuff</b> - I've put together the structure/syllabus of sorts of textbooks each for undergraduate Physics, Chemistry, and Biology from Susan Fowler's website and MIT OCW respectively, but I mostly plan to focus on Physics and Biology.</li>
                <li><b>Econs stuff</b> - I'm trying to find a good monetary economics book with minimum math, or at least light on math. If anyone knows please let me know.</li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
