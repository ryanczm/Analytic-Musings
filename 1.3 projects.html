            <h2>Planned projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NLP project</b>. For learning, familiarizing with concepts and application. Can try for finance related idea.</li>
                <li><b>Time Series Forecasting project</b>. Same reason as above.</li>
                <li><b>Deep Learning project</b>. Not too sure what kind of architecture and problem, but need to do research and learn, but clear the first two first before learning this stuff.</li>
                <li><b>Predicting PE/LBO candidate success</b>. The idea is that the theoretical variability in what makes a good LBO candidate has been quite invariant/stationary over time, a model can be trained on past exit metrics and fundamental data of the target when it was bought out.
                    However, when drafting this, PE exit metrics (IRR, MoM multiples, etc) for PE firms exits are undisclosed. Preqin does not disclose asset-level return metrics, measuring performance at the
                    fund level instead. Unfortunately, the data is not available to non-institutions. </li>
                <li>Assessing the validity of Equity Research price targets (Again, data exclusivity is the problem)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Books/stuff to learn:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elements of Computing Systems (Nisham)</b> - This might be important for a lower-level, bottom-up, foundational understanding which underpins alot of programming ideas.</li>
                <li><b>Computer Networks (Kurose and Ross)</b> - Again, a lower level foundation but for networks and connectivity related programming concepts.</li>
                <li><b>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)</b> - For DS & A.</li>
                <li><i>Elementary Linear Algebra (Anton)</i> - Need to relook because I don't think I fully grasped Messer + Messer was very messy because it was a super low-res scanned version.</li>
                <li><i>Discrete Math Structures book</i> (Kolman/Busby/Ross or Susanna) - Discrete math.</li>
                <li><i>Set Theory book or Naive Set Theory (Halmos)</i> - Set Theory and Logic, to complement the above. Read some of it before Discrete Math book.</li>
                <li>Graph Theory book (Gould) - Graph Theory.</li>
                <li>Differential Equations book (Chapman/Hall or Zill or Boyce/Mead or Tenebaum/Pollard) - Just because it was to the right of Calculus on the roadmap. But less important for me.</li>
                <li>Flask/API stuff.</li>
                <li>Virtualization/container Docker/Kubernetes (After reading the books.Not too sure where or how to learn this? )</li>
                <li>Distributed/Parallel software (Apache Spark, PySpark, Hadoop, Scala) (Again, not too sure where or how to learn this)</li>
                <li>AWS stuff (Just try and learn about the basics) - (Not too sure where to learn - what book or online course?) </li>
                <li>JS and JS framework (React or similar)</li>                
                <li>Try to learn some basics of a lower level language like C or C++ (Again, not too sure the best way of doing this, but it is a long way down the list so I won't be getting here soon) </li>
                <li><b>Cognitive framework or "Theory of Learning"</b>- to expound on this framework, document it and test it by self-learning.</li>
            </ul>
