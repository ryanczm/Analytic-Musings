                <h2>What is a Metacognitive Framework?</h2>
         
                <p>What is intelligence? What are the different types of intelligence? Why are some people brilliant in their different fields? Can we distill the different types of intelligence into a general framework? The central question I've been thinking about is this: <b>How do we optimally think about each field?</b></p>
                <!-- <p>Where <b>field</b> can be (non-rigorously defined) as an area of expertise - like mathematics, physics, computing, etc. Or more generally, sciences, humanities. Or even more generally, intellectual pursuits, sports, arts. </p>
                <h3>A Metacognitive Framework</h3> -->
                <p>Well, the fundamental idea I want to introduce is a metacognitive framework. The idea is that we can observe very smart people in different fields, try to distill their underlying patterns of thought, 
                    and capture them in the right syntactic expression - and learn the optimal pattern of thought for each field. </p>
                <p>
                    Very roughly, this amounts to identifying experts/masters of their fields, looking up interviews on YouTube, and 
                        analyzing their thought process and capturing it in the right words. A sort of maximum likelihood estimation-esque process, but instead of fitting numerical parameters, we fit "words" or "prompts". Long interviews are the best data for this parameter-fitting process.
                        
                    </p>
                <!-- <p>Then, once we capture these ideal patterns, we (laypeople) can practice using them to learn in a particular field. This implies geniuses are born or naturally use these patterns of thought - it comes easy to them - but laypeople do not. But with a <a href="metacognition.html#Frameworks">framework</a>, we can distill these patterns and practice.</p>
                <p>This, however, <strong>doesn&#39;t downplay the role of hard work and natural ability</strong>. Knowing the ideal pattern of thought for a field is insufficient - one needs to apply it. Some people can wield these abilities better than others - that is natural ability at work. But as the name suggests, if natural ability is immutable, then we can only work within the constraints of our natural talent to maximize our ability.</p>
                <p>How are we going to go about doing this? Well, via this <i>iterative process:</i></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Identify the different fields of knowledge (Complexity assumption)</li>
                <li>Watch or observe experts in fields (Optimal thought assumption)</li>
                <li>Infer their thought process or <i>pattern of thought</i>. </li>
                <li>Capture the pattern of thought with the right words (Syntactic prompt assumption)</li>
                <li>Apply the pattern of thought to see if it works.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Essentially, this is a fancy way of saying observing smart people to extrapolate how they think. I&#39;ll call the different fields and the collection of optimal patterns of thought a <em>metacognitive framework</em>. Notice each point is built on a certain assumption in parentheses.</p>

            
            </section> -->

            <section id="Assumptions">
                <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                <p>Here are some assumptions:</p>
                <ul>
                <!-- <li><strong>Intelligence Assumption</strong> - Intelligence is the perception of reality. </li> -->
                <!-- <li><strong>Complexity Assumption</strong> - Reality is infinitely complex. </li> -->
                <li><strong>Optimal Thought Assumption</strong> - Different fields have different <em>patterns of thoughts</em> that are optimal to understanding them.</li>
                <!-- <li><strong>Natural Talent Assumption</strong> - Certain people are innately gifted at different fields because they are naturally predisposed in thinking a certain way that suits that field.</li> -->
                <li><strong>Learning Rate Assumption</strong> - Gifted people in a certain field have a faster learning rate than others in that area because they can utilize the optimal <em>way of thinking</em> for that field.</li>
                <!-- <li><strong>Observation Assumption</strong>  - We can observe gifted people and distill their underlying logical framework or <em>ways of thinking</em> - much like filtering hidden states from noisy observables.</li> -->
                <li><strong>Syntactic Prompt Assumption ðŸ’­</strong> - These <em>ways of thinking</em>, or <em>patterns of thought</em> can be distilled or described by the right words. Think of it as prompting, but instead of input to an LLM, it is input to our brains. So, what are the right prompts to trigger the correct pattern of thought in our minds. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>While PoincarÃ©'s more famous quote was the last sentence, the bold text illustrates the importance of the right prompt.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>We have just seen, through an example, how important words are in Mathematics, but I could cite many others. <strong>One can hardly believe how a well-chosen word can provide economy of thought</strong>, as Mach said. I do not recall whether I have already mentioned somewhere that Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.</p>

            <section id="Learning">
                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                
                <p>But how do these <em>patterns of thought</em> explain the learning process? We can also distill the learning process like so:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Space of Knowledge - There is a space of knowledge that exists. </li>
                <li>Sampling - People sample from the space of knowledge.</li>
                <li>Application - People apply their <em>patterns of thought</em> to the knowledge to build their own understanding (knowledge graph).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page1A.png" height=325 class="center">  
                <!-- <p>Then, the task is to find out:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The different fields of knowledge (phenomena).</li>
                <li>The different patterns of thought that are optimal for these fields.</li>
                <li>The universal patterns of thought that are optimal to general intelligence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And so, we can begin with the different fields of knowledge - which I call <i>phenomena</i>.</p> -->

            </section>

            
            <section id="Phenomena">
                <h2>Phenomena</h2>
                <p>Phenomena, or knowledge, represents the collection of different subjects of study. I define three categories: deterministic, semi-deterministic, and humanistic phenomena.</p>
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page1B.png" height=350 class="center"> 
                
                <p><b>Deterministic</b> phenomena are phenomena that have fixed laws that don&#39;t change over time - they are invariant. </p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>This description generally describes fields that study fixed laws of nature - <i>mathematics, natural sciences and engineering</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <p>(The term &#39;deterministic&#39; has different meanings in physics, probability and philosophy - in this case, I overloaded it to mean &#39;fixed&#39; - because the former sounds better).</p>
                 -->
                <p><b>Semi-deterministic</b> phenomena are phenomena that have deterministic nature - fixed laws - which are manmade abstractions. This generally describes the field of <i>computing</i>. They are fixed, but can be created or destroyed by man, in that sense they can &#39;change&#39;.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>This type of phenomena is only for computing - whereby man creates these laws by making computers execute instructions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <p><b>Humanistic</b> phenomena arise from human interactions which are weakly deterministic. The â€˜lawsâ€™ constantly change and cannot be formalized. This phenomena generally describes these fields:
                <i>history, economics and politics</i>.</p>
                <!-- <p>Now, we can figure out optimal patterns of thought for each of these phenomena.</p> -->

            </section>

            <section id="Frameworks">
                <h2>Duality and Frameworks</h2>
                <p>So, I propose that each phenomena can be thought of in two ways: a <b>primal form</b>, involving concepts and their connections as a <b>graph</b>, and a <b>dual</b> form, involving <b>visualising</b> these phenomena in real-time. We borrow the term duality from optimization, invoking the idea that a problem may be viewed from two perspectives: the primal or dual problem.</p>

                <h2>Primal Form: Graphs</h2>
                
                <p>The idea is that regardless of the type of phenomena, knowledge can be represented as a <b>graph</b>. The nodes are individual elements, and edges are connections. The understanding is the graph formed. So we have:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Nodes | Units | Atoms </b> - Individual pieces of understanding. The atomic building block for that phenomena.</li>
                <li><b>Edges | Connections | Molecules</b> - Connections between the nodes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The key idea is that the nature of nodes and edges are <b>different</b> for each type of phenomenon. We first cover on the primal form below.</p>
                
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page2.png" height=350 class="center"> 

                
             <h2>Deterministic Framework</h2>
                <p>Example Fields: Mathematics, natural sciences, engineering.</p>

                <p>We define two types of atomic nodes: <b>concepts</b> and <b>measurements</b>. By the syntactic prompt assumption, they can be represented with words (or symbols):</p>
               
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><b>Unit: Concept | Measurement</b> - An abstract concept or a physical measurement </li>         
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>We can then <b>connect</b> concepts or measurements to each other.</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><b>Edge: Connection</b> - Connect ðŸ’­ concepts/measurements to each other.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                  <p>The result being:</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><b>Graph: Proofs, theorems, equations</b> - The result of connecting various measurements or concepts together.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>A connection can be <em>direct</em> or <em>latent</em>.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Direct</em> connections are obvious and well-defined. If one concept or measurement is defined in terms of several others - then it is a direct connection.</li>
                <li><em>Latent</em> connections are connections that are not explicitly defined. They represent similarities or links between concepts that one can form via some sudden realization. Often times, one makes latent connections between two seeming unrelated concepts in different fields.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, the connections should be dense and near. Dense meaning for a given space, the amount of connections is large. Near meaning for a given two points in space, one forms a chain of many small connections to get from one point to another.
                </p>
                <h2>Deterministic Evidence</h2>
                <p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>

                <p>Feynman explains heat a bunch of atoms jiggling and spreading their jiggling to others via contact. Now, indirectly, he is imagining a measurement (the jiggling) and showing how that interacts with another measurement (another bunch of atoms jiggling). </p>
      
         

                <h2>Semideterministic Framework</h2>
        
                <p>For semi-deterministic phenomena, the basic unit (node) is <strong>data</strong>.</p>
                <ul>

                <li><strong>Unit: Data</strong> - Data, memory. This can be visualised as anything, really. E.g a circle, an array, a range of memory addresses, whatever. Be creative.</b>.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>Well, what do we do with it? We put in into a black box, called an operation, and out comes another node!</p>

                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Edge: Operation/Black Box</strong> - Visualise as a black box with any number of inputs and outputs. The job of the box is to take in some inputs and produce some outputs.
                        Note, it doesn't always have to create a new output, it can simply modify the input data in-place (arrow out from the box back into the input). 
                        It doesn't need to be 1-to-1, it could be many-to-many. The key phrase/prompt here is <b><i>"what it does/how it works"</i></b>ðŸ’­.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>Now comes the problematic part. I suspect, that the computer science way of thinking is fundamentally different from the sciency/math way of thinking. Applying one to another just won't work. 
                    At the risk of sounding crazy, I suspect that in science/math style (deterministic), we start with fundamental building blocks, and go bottom up. In computer science style (semi-deterministic),
                    we start from the top: a simple black box connecting inputs to output. We can then break down the box into a set of further parts.
                </p>
        
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Decomposition/Breaking Down</strong> - Peering inside a black box and breaking it into more data and black boxes. The prompt is <b><i>"This can be broken down into"</b></i>ðŸ’­. </li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>

                 <p>So, we start with a given problem, how to take some inputs and get some outputs we want. There's the black box, from the top-down approach. We then break it down into smaller pieces, and those smaller pieces into smaller pieces, 
                    so on and so forth, in a <i>top-down</i> fashion.

                <p><strong>Data</strong></p>
                <p>The core idea comes from this video from George Hotz&#39; livestream:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p><b>Input â†’ system (computation) â†’ output</b>. This is my core paradigm for understanding anything.</p>

                <p>Hotz&#39; states the idea clearly here - it&#39;s all about thinking in terms of inputs and outputs.</p>
                <p><strong>Top-down</strong></p>
                <p>Next, they interact to form computation/abstraction layers. Jim Keller and Donald Knuth both express this idea independently:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>There's a relatively good understanding of <b>abstraction layers</b>. Atoms, silicon, transistors, logic gates, functional units, processing elements, instruction sets, languages - abstraction layers from the atom to the datacenter. </p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39;Being able to see something at lots of levels and <b>go between them smoothly</b> seems to be more pronounced in people that resonate with computing&#39;.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>â€”Donald Knuth, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdBfsXbST8&ab_channel=LexFridman&t=553">Donald Knuth | Lex Fridman Podcast #62 (9:13)</a></cite></figcaption>
                
                <p>Clearly, the idea is to exhibit top-down thinking. For example, deconstructing a unit of data into further units, or a computation into further computation steps.</p>

                <h2>Humanistic Framework</h2>
                <p>This is tough. As mentioned, these types of phenomena are related to human behavior. For example, economics, discretionary trading, (geo)politics, organisational dynamics, etc. In these cases, the unit is the <strong>actor</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Unit: Actor</strong> - A person or collective entity. Actors have a <b>utility function</b>, a <b>perspective</b> and can perform <b>actions</b>. The prompt is <b><i>"who/what"</i></b>ðŸ’­.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, actors interact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Edge: Interaction</strong> - An actor performs an action. This is an edge that propagates to other actors, which in turn causes them to take actions. In this case, the key is not the action itself, but the rationale behind it. 
                        The  The prompt is <b><i>"why?"</i></b>ðŸ’­ </li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>The result being: </p>
                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Graph: Situation</strong> - A situation arising from multiple actors interacting.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>

                <p>As of November 2023, I have been thinking about this part of the framework. This is the most difficult framework to formalize. I believe, very strongly, that the masters of this style of thinking are often found in finance, 
                    in particular discretionary trading. This is because markets are simply a collection of actors performing actions based on different views and intentions.</p>
                <p>Thus, we first ask, for any particular situation, who the actors are. Then, we set up their objectives and views, and try to simulate a situation or possible outcomes. There are historical situations, in which the connections already happened and we retrospectively ask why actors took such actions, etc
                    . And there are future situations, which our goal is to, based on past knowledge of situations, forecast how they will play out accurately. </p>
                <h2>Humanistic Evidence</h2>

                <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>
                <p>This idea came from <em>Soros&#39; The Alchemy of Finance</em>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39;My framework is built on two propositions. The first is that in situations that have thinking <b>participants</b>, the participantsâ€™ <b>views</b> of the world never perfectly correspond to the actual state of affairs.
                 The second proposition is that these imperfect views can influence the situation to which they relate through the <b>actions</b> of the participants.&#39;</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Note the key terms used - Soros&#39; thinks in terms of participants (actors) and their actions. He wrote: <i>"My framework was largely dismissed as the conceit of a man who has been successful in business and therefore fancies himself as a philosopher".</i></p>

                <p>For deterministic phenomena, basically math and physics (placeholder for science since it is the most fundamental discipline), we want to visualise concepts or variables.

                <p>For semideterministic phenomena, basically computer science, we want to visualise how data is transformed. This can be done at different abstraction levels: the level of code (visualising a for loop do work across an array), the level of systems (visualising information being encoded into a packet and sent via some network), etc. The key difference, however, is that unlike in deterministic visualisation,
                    we are happy visualising at a level of abstraction. For example, it is impossible to visualise how a CPU executes machine codes because of how fast and complex it is, so we visualise, say, an array in our head, or a graph, or flow control, etc.

                <p>The next question is, given effort, how fast can one learn or progress? Consider ability $A$ as a function of effort (time) $t$, $A(t)$.</p>
