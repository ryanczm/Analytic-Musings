                <!-- <p>Where <b>field</b> can be (non-rigorously defined) as an area of expertise - like mathematics, physics, computing, etc. Or more generally, sciences, humanities. Or even more generally, intellectual pursuits, sports, arts. </p>
                <h3>A Metacognitive Framework</h3> -->
                <p>In this post, I explore the notion that one can observe very smart people in different fields, try to distill their underlying patterns of thought, 
                    and capture them in the right syntax to learn the optimal pattern of thought for each field. </p>

            <section id="Assumptions">
                <p>I posit these patterns of thought can be captured by invoking the right word. The idea is illustrated below in this quote:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>We have just seen, through an example, how important words are in Mathematics, but I could cite many others. <strong>One can hardly believe how a well-chosen word can provide economy of thought</strong>, as Mach said. I do not recall whether I have already mentioned somewhere that Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.</p>

                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                
                <p>But how do these <em>patterns of thought</em> explain the learning process? We can also distill the learning process like so:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Space of Knowledge - There is a space of knowledge that exists. </li>
                <li>Sampling - People sample from the space of knowledge.</li>
                <li>Application - People apply their <em>patterns of thought</em> to the knowledge to build their own understanding (knowledge graph).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page1A.png" height=325 class="center">  
                <!-- <p>Then, the task is to find out:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The different fields of knowledge (phenomena).</li>
                <li>The different patterns of thought that are optimal for these fields.</li>
                <li>The universal patterns of thought that are optimal to general intelligence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And so, we can begin with the different fields of knowledge - which I call <i>phenomena</i>.</p> -->

            </section>

            
            <section id="Phenomena">
                <h2>Phenomena</h2>
                <p>Phenomena, or knowledge, represents the collection of different subjects of study. I define three categories: deterministic, semi-deterministic, and humanistic phenomena.</p>
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page1B.png" height=350 class="center"> 
                
                <p><b>Deterministic</b> phenomena are phenomena that have fixed laws that don&#39;t change over time - they are invariant. </p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>This description generally describes fields that study fixed laws of nature - <i>mathematics, natural sciences and engineering</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <p>(The term &#39;deterministic&#39; has different meanings in physics, probability and philosophy - in this case, I overloaded it to mean &#39;fixed&#39; - because the former sounds better).</p>
                 -->
                <p><b>Semi-deterministic</b> phenomena are phenomena that have deterministic nature - fixed laws - which are manmade abstractions. This generally describes the field of <i>computing</i>. They are fixed, but can be created or destroyed by man, in that sense they can &#39;change&#39;.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>This type of phenomena is only for computing - whereby man creates these laws by making computers execute instructions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <p><b>Humanistic</b> phenomena arise from human interactions which are weakly deterministic. The ‘laws’ constantly change and cannot be formalized. This phenomena generally describes these fields:
                <i>history, economics and politics</i>.</p>
                <!-- <p>Now, we can figure out optimal patterns of thought for each of these phenomena.</p> -->

            </section>

            <section id="Frameworks">
                <h2>Duality and Frameworks</h2>
                <p>So, I propose that each phenomena can be thought of in two ways: a <b>primal form</b>, involving concepts and their connections as a <b>graph</b>, and a <b>dual</b> form, involving <b>visualising</b> these phenomena in real-time. We borrow the term duality from optimization, invoking the idea that a problem may be viewed from two perspectives: the primal or dual problem.</p>

                <h2>Primal Form: Graphs</h2>
                
                <p>The idea is that regardless of the type of phenomena, knowledge can be represented as a <b>graph</b>. The nodes are individual elements, and edges are connections. The understanding is the graph formed. So we have:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Nodes | Units | Atoms </b> - Individual pieces of understanding. The atomic building block for that phenomena.</li>
                <li><b>Edges | Connections | Molecules</b> - Connections between the nodes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The key idea is that the nature of nodes and edges are <b>different</b> for each type of phenomenon. We first cover on the primal form below.</p>
                
                <img src="images/metacognition/Page2.png" height=350 class="center"> 

                
             <h2>Deterministic Framework</h2>
                <p>Example Fields: Mathematics, natural sciences, engineering.</p>

                <p>We define two types of atomic nodes: <b>concepts</b> and <b>measurements</b>. By the syntactic prompt assumption, they can be represented with words (or symbols):</p>
               
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><b>Unit: Concept | Measurement</b> - An abstract concept or a physical measurement </li>         
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>We can then <b>connect</b> concepts or measurements to each other.</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><b>Edge: Connection</b> - Connect 💭 concepts/measurements to each other.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                  <p>The result being:</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><b>Graph: Proofs, theorems, equations</b> - The result of connecting various measurements or concepts together.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>A connection can be <em>direct</em> or <em>latent</em>.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Direct</em> connections are obvious and well-defined. If one concept or measurement is defined in terms of several others - then it is a direct connection.</li>
                <li><em>Latent</em> connections are connections that are not explicitly defined. They represent similarities or links between concepts that one can form via some sudden realization. Often times, one makes latent connections between two seeming unrelated concepts in different fields.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, the connections should be dense and near. Dense meaning for a given space, the amount of connections is large. Near meaning for a given two points in space, one forms a chain of many small connections to get from one point to another.
                </p>
                <h2>Deterministic Evidence</h2>
                <p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>
                <p>To explain how I derived the notion of concepts and connections, we turn to this video:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y2sGLM0WGY&amp;ab_channel=Breakthrough">Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics 2014</a>. </p>

                <blockquote>

                <!-- <p>Similarly, things fitting together in an unexpected way implies drawing new connections between concepts were previously there were none! The same idea is expressed by both mathematicians.</p> -->
                <!-- <p><b>[GRAPHIC HERE - latent connections]</b></p> -->
                <p>Notice the choice of words in bold: they imply connecting something (ideas/concepts) together. </p>
                <p><strong>Measurements</strong></p>
                <p>Next, we turn to Feynman.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39;Atoms in the coffee jiggle, which makes the cup jiggle. Heat is just jiggling spreading, which is easy to understand&#39;.</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39; It's a mixture of partial solving of equations ... and having some sort of <b>picture</b> of what's happening that the equations saying&#39;.</p>

                <figcaption>—Richard Feynman, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA&ab_channel=ChristopherSykes&t=3378">Fun to Imagine (56:18)</a></cite></figcaption>
                <p>Feynman explains heat a bunch of atoms jiggling and spreading their jiggling to others via contact. Now, indirectly, he is imagining a measurement (the jiggling) and showing how that interacts with another measurement (another bunch of atoms jiggling). </p>
      
         

                <h2>Semideterministic Framework</h2>
        
                <p>For semi-deterministic phenomena, the basic unit (node) is <strong>data</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Unit: Data</strong> - Data, memory. This can be visualised as anything, really. Arrays, nodes, boxes, whatever.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>Well, what do we do with it? It interacts with a black box, called an operation, which interacts with another node of data!</p>

                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Edge: Interaction/Black Box</strong> - Visualise as a black box with any number of inputs and outputs. The job of the box is to take in some inputs and produce some outputs.
                        The key idea is it connects two or more nodes of data together via an interaction.
                        It doesn't need to be 1-to-1, it could be many-to-many. The key phrase/prompt here is <b><i>"this interacts with"</i></b>💭.</li>
                    </blockquote>     
                </ul>
                
                
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Decomposition/Breaking Down</strong> - Peering inside a black box and breaking it into more data and black boxes. The prompt is <b><i>"This can be broken down into"</b></i>💭. </li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>

                 <p>So, we start with a given problem, how to take some inputs and get some outputs we want. There's the black box, from the top-down approach. We then break it down into smaller pieces, and those smaller pieces into smaller pieces, 
                    so on and so forth, in a <i>top-down</i> fashion.

                <h2>Semideterministic Evidence</h2>
                <p><strong>Data</strong></p>
                <p>The core idea comes from this video from George Hotz&#39; livestream:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p><b>Input → system (computation) → output</b>. This is my core paradigm for understanding anything.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>—George Hotz, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI&ab_channel=georgehotzarchive&t=3240">What is Programming? (Noob Lessons!) (54:00)</a></cite></figcaption>
                <p>Hotz&#39; states the idea clearly here - it&#39;s all about thinking in terms of inputs and outputs.</p>
                <p><strong>Top-down</strong></p>
                <p>Next, they interact to form computation/abstraction layers. Jim Keller and Donald Knuth both express this idea independently:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>There's a relatively good understanding of <b>abstraction layers</b>. Atoms, silicon, transistors, logic gates, functional units, processing elements, instruction sets, languages - abstraction layers from the atom to the datacenter. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>—Jim Keller, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA&ab_channel=LexFridman&t=250">Jim Keller | Lex Fridman Podcast #70 (4:10)</a></cite></figcaption>
                <br>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39;Being able to see something at lots of levels and <b>go between them smoothly</b> seems to be more pronounced in people that resonate with computing&#39;.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>—Donald Knuth, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdBfsXbST8&ab_channel=LexFridman&t=553">Donald Knuth | Lex Fridman Podcast #62 (9:13)</a></cite></figcaption>
                
                <p>Clearly, the idea is to exhibit top-down thinking. For example, deconstructing a unit of data into further units, or a computation into further computation steps.</p>

                <p>This is tough. As mentioned, these types of phenomena are related to human behavior. For example, economics, discretionary trading, (geo)politics, organisational dynamics, etc. In these cases, the unit is the <strong>actor</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Unit: Actor</strong> - A person or collective entity. Actors have a <b>utility function</b>, a <b>perspective</b> and can perform <b>actions</b>. The prompt is <b><i>"who/what"</i></b>💭.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, actors interact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Edge: Interaction</strong> - An actor performs an action. This is an edge that propagates to other actors, which in turn causes them to take actions. In this case, the key is not the action itself, but the rationale behind it. 
                        The  The prompt is <b><i>"why?"</i></b>💭 </li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>
                <p>The result being: </p>
                <ul>
                    <blockquote>
                    <li><strong>Graph: Situation</strong> - A situation arising from multiple actors interacting.</li>
                </blockquote>
                </ul>

                <p>As of November 2023, I have been thinking about this part of the framework. This is the most difficult framework to formalize. I believe, very strongly, that the masters of this style of thinking are often found in finance, 
                    in particular discretionary trading. This is because markets are simply a collection of actors performing actions based on different views and intentions.</p>
                <h2>Humanistic Evidence</h2>

                <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>
                <p>This idea came from <em>Soros&#39; The Alchemy of Finance</em>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&#39;My framework is built on two propositions. The first is that in situations that have thinking <b>participants</b>, the participants’ <b>views</b> of the world never perfectly correspond to the actual state of affairs.
                 The second proposition is that these imperfect views can influence the situation to which they relate through the <b>actions</b> of the participants.&#39;</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Note the key terms used - Soros&#39; thinks in terms of participants (actors) and their actions. He wrote: <i>"My framework was largely dismissed as the conceit of a man who has been successful in business and therefore fancies himself as a philosopher".</i></p>

                <h2>Dual Form: Visualisation</h2>
                <p>The counterpart to the graph is to visualise these phenomena in real time. The primal form deals with symbols and words, the dual form visualises them. </p>
                <h3 id="Deterministic-visualisation">Deterministic Visualisation</h3>
                <p>For deterministic phenomena, basically math and physics (placeholder for science since it is the most fundamental discipline), we want to visualise concepts or variables. The more complex or fine-grained the simulation, the better. Basically, we parameterize elements in the simulation by numbers.</p>
                <h3 id="Semideterministic-visualisation">Semideterministic Visualisation </h3>
                <p>For semideterministic phenomena, basically computer science, we want to visualise how data is transformed. This visualisation is done at a level of abstraction, meaning what we visualise is not what is physically occuring.</p>
                <h3 id="Humanisticic-visualisation">Humanistic Visualisation </h3>
                <p>I do not know how to capture this idea but I believe it involves visualising actors and actions as a graph/mindmap of sorts. </p>

                <p>Some believe talent is innate. Others believe it can be grown. My perspective is talent can be developed by invoking the optimal pattern of thought via the right syntax, but the rate of learning/skill improvement is ultimately constrained by natural ability.</p>

                <p>To sum up this post, I propose we can classify subjects into: deterministic (natural sciences), semi-deterministic (computation), humanistic (humanities). Each type has an optimal way of thinking, different from the other,
                    which we can distill by observing experts in each subject and extrapolating their thought process via the correct syntax. Once we do so, learning becomes faster, but our speed is constrained by our natural talent.       </p>
