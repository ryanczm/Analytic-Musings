        <h3> Energy Analyst [at] General Index</h3>
        <p>
        As an analyst, I was responsible for the daily price assessment process for middle (jet fuel, diesel) and heavy distillates (marine fuel). 
        </p>
        <p>I used Python to automate data parsing and price assessments, formulating assessment/market rules as a constraint programming/optimization problem, resulting in a more objective assessment process with significant time savings.

        <h3> Junior Data Scientist [at] UOB</h3>
        <p>
        As a junior data scientist, I built Question-Answering (QA) systems for internal policy documents via the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM paradigm.
        I also forecasted ATM usage/demand islandwide with econometrics and classical ML methods in order to optimize refills. Shortly after I left, OpenAI released custom GPTs.
