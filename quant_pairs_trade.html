                <h2>Strategy Overview</h2>
         
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>For those of you who have actual experience as a QR or QT, this post might seem painfully amateurish. And that’s because it is. In this post I implement a simple pairs trading strategy based on bivariate cointegration tests in the selection phase on NASDAQ 100 equities. The selection phase will be based on data from 2018-2021. The trading & evaluation phase will be from 2021-2023. I then analyze further trends between cointegration, returns and sector in the data. The repo is <a href="https://github.com/ryanczm/qr/blob/master/ryan_qm_project.ipynb">here</a>. No third party backtesting or analysis libraries were used.</p>
                <h3>Caveats and Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>Certain implementation aspects were not addressed that would make such a strategy impractical live: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Survivorship Bias</i> – The in-sample period starts from 2018 so I should have simulated the strategy using the historical index constituents of the NASDAQ 100 in 2018, but finding these was surprisingly non-trivial.</li>
                        <li><i>Transaction Costs</i> – The backtest does not simulate broker commissions.</li>
                        <li><i>Liquidity, Market Impact & Scaling</i> – The backtest does not simulate market impact. Low liquidity would mean trades filling at execution prices too far from the theoretical order price, especially with larger notionals.</li>
                        <li><i>Spurious/Decaying Cointegration</i> – Cointegration could be spurious or decay quickly.</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Selection & Trading Phase</h2>
                    
                <h3>Universe & Cointegration Tests</h3>
                    <p>The data used was daily OHLCV from yfinance. I didn’t adjust for corporate actions (share buybacks, dividend payouts). I then select pairs based off the bivariate Engle-Granger cointegration test on the in-sample period (2018-2021) From my understanding, this test first regresses one series against the other to get the beta coefficient, creates the spread/residual series from the linear combination of the two, then performs a unit root test on the spread:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/1_code_cointegration.png", height="400", class="center">
                    <p>This lets us select pairs which are cointegrated for the in-sample period (2018 to Jan 2021). However, more pairs and tests exposes us to <i><a href="https://www.quantrocket.com/codeload/quant-finance-lectures/quant_finance_lectures/Lecture23-p-Hacking-and-Multiple-Comparisons-Bias.ipynb.html">multiple comparison bias</a></i>, which
                    invalides the interpretation of p-values as the number of tests increase. To adjust this, we can use the Bonferroni correction, which adjusts our statistically significant p-value cutoff. I didn't do that here.</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/cointegration_heatmap.png", height="950", class="center">
                <h3>Trading Phase</h3>
                    <p>Once pairs are selected, we compute a spread for each pair. Then, we smooth it out, and set entry/exit thresholds. The spread is computed off a dynamic hedge ratio, evolved in online, recursive fashion via a Kalman filter (which turns out to be surprisingly effective at keeping a spread stationary even if the underlying assets are not as cointegrated!) </p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/2_code_kalman.png", height="430", class="center">
                    <p>The spread is then z-scored via two rolling windows. The shorter average of the past $z_s$ days is demeaned by a longer average of the past $z_l$ days, then divided by the standard deviation of $z_l$.  We enter positions when this spread is above $[z,-z]$ and exit when it crosses 0. If it crosses the top, long the bottom asset and short the top asset to form the top leg, and vice versa. The parameters are thus the short (5D) and long (30D) windows and the thresholds (0.5 and -0.5). </p>

                <h3>Single Pair Demonstration</h3>
                    <p>To illustrate, I chose an arbitrary same-sector from the backtest, INTC vs QCOM, with out-sample Sharpe of 1.467 (75th percentile) and a I.R of 0.78 (75th percentile).</p>
                    <p>Here is the price chart for the pair:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/intl_qcom_prices.png", height="400", width="1000" class="center">
                    <p>The z-scored spread defines the entry and exit times:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/intl_qcom_z.png", height="400", width="1000" class="center">
                    <p>Which is then reflected on the actual spread itself:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/intl_qcom_spread.png", height="400", width="1000" class="center">
                    <p>We can run this simulation for all pairs in a chosen set and get the cumulative value/return for the out-of-sample period to analyze. I separated into in-sample/out-sample and same-sector/all pairs. The idea is to only screen for same-sector pairs based on a higher likelihood of some economic relationship. We'll investigate this later. In total, we have ~4000 possible pairs, but ~400 cointegrated ones according to the test statistic and 90 of those from the same-sector.</p>

            <section id="Performance Analysis">
                <h2>Performance</h2>
                    <p>Before analyzing the relationship between sectors, cointegration and returns more closely, I first examine the out-of-sample performance (start 2021 to 2023 Feb) of selected sets of pairs.</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/4_code_test_sharpe.png", height="385", class="center">
                <h3>Sharpe Ratio Caveats</h3>
                    <p>One problem I had with calculation of returns and Sharpe was the initial capital for a pair. If we start from 0 initial capital, the first few months tends to give very volatile returns. Returns for the first few round trip trades tend to be disproportionate, despite portfolio value changing very little, as seen by the equity curve. This increases volatility and compresses the Sharpe ratio calculation.</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/intl_qcom_equity_curve.png", height="355", class="center">
                    <p>I decided to smooth it out by starting with initial capital equal to the hedge ratio times the stock price at the start of the period. I’m not sure if this is corrrect. </p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/intl_qcom_normrets.png", height="355", class="center">
                <h3>Sector vs No Sector Restriction Performance</h3>
                    <p>I then iterated through all selected pairs with a p-value less than the arbitary cutoff of 0.10: ~430 pairs with no sector restriction and ~96 pairs with sector restriction.</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/sharpe.png", height="400", class="center">
                    <p>The average mean and median annualized Sharpe for both sets of pairs was roughly the same ~0.60, and ~0.82. However, from the histogram, it is evident the no-sector restriction pairs has an extreme left tail of poor performers while the same-sector pairs had a floor on bad performance. This would support the hypothesis that cointegrated same-sector pairs are less likely to perform poorly out-sample because they have a higher likelihood of some underlying economic relationship. </p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/ir.png", height="400", class="center">
                    <p>IR was decent with a median of ~0.35 and a mean of ~0.45, beating the benchmark. However, I am not sure if IR is relevant here because pairs trading is market neutral anyway. We can then plot cumulative (mean) returns against the benchmark:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/cumrets_is.png", height="400", class="center"> 
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/cumrets_oos.png", height="400", class="center">
                    <p>If anything, I guess this is graphical representation of what a market-neutral strategy is? Glad I found out what it looked like.</p>

            <section id="Cointegration, Returns & Sector Analysis">
                <h2>Cointegration, Returns & Sector Analysis</h2>
                    I wanted to analyze the relationships between sector, cointegration and return.
                <h3>Cointegration Trends by Sector</h3>
                    <p><i>Does same sector mean more likely to be cointegrated?</i> We can look in-sample at the empirical distributions of p-values for all pairs vs same-sector pairs:</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/pval_comparison.png", height="400", class="center">
                    <p>Unfortunately, the difference seems to be very marginal. The KDE plots show only very minor differences. Which means that the proportion of cointegration is roughly the same!</p>
                    <p>We can also analyze, in-sample, how cointegration trends differ across sectors. The number of pairs per sector is disproportionate, since NDX is heavily comprised of technology stocks. However, it seems industrials and consumer staples have a greater proportion of cointegrated stocks.</p>
                    <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/pval_sector.png", height="300", class="center">
                <h3>Cointegration as an Alpha Factor</h3>
                    <p><i>How well does cointegration imply Sharpe?</i> Ideally, we would run the strategy for all pairs (~4000), calculate their in-sample Sharpes, then compute the Spearman rank or Pearson correlation coefficient with p-values. Due to computation, I did this for the top and bottom deciles of p-value (<0.10 and >0.80) as a form of pseudo-quantile analysis.</p>
                        <img src="images/quant_pairs_trade/pval_vs_sharpe.png", height="500", class="center">
                    <p>I would have expected a stronger correlation. However (not shown here) I think the high Sharpe ratios of non-cointegrated pairs seem to be due to the power of the Kalman filter and my very simplistic backtest. When I plotted spreads of least cointegrated pairs, they all looked quite stationary, so I am attributing this to the Kalman filter.</p>
                <h3>Cointegration Decay & Transfer Coefficient </h3>
                <h3>Best vs Worst Pairs Analysis </h3>
            </section>

            <section id="Conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>A Proper Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Given this, a potential strategy would be to rerun this model at a fixed interval, e.g quarterly, on a lagged window of data, then and rebalancing your portfolio to trade the best performing same-sector pairs (based on the backtest) each quarter. However, given that I did not account for transaction costs in the backtest, these numbers are probably unrealistic.</p>
                <h3>Learning Points</h3>
                    <p>From this exercise, I’ve definitely got some practice to analyzing and handling financial data, and practicing my visualisation skills as well. However, there are many things I should do that I did not manage to do in this post:</p>

            <p>From this exercise, I’ve definitely got some practice to analyzing and handling financial data, and practicing my visualisation skills as well. However, there are many things I should do that I did not manage to do in this post: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulate and understand the impact of transaction costs and liquidity (commissions, market impact) which is especially important in a small-margins strategy like pairs trading.</li>
                <li>Simulate running a strategy in a periodic fashion (e.g rerunning the models every quarter) to rebalance the portfolio of pairs trade</li>
                <li>Aspects of portfolio optimization or weight allocation</li>
                <li>Simulate risk management measures (e.g exit rule if pair doesn’t close after x weeks).</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Again, if this seems amateurish, please do remember I am still learning and wanted to practice and try things out. I hope to experiment further and even try out a live trading strategy some time (not with pairs trading of course)!</p>
