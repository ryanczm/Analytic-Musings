## Power

Power is an interesting commodity and unique on it's own relative to other commodities. Trafigura's Commodities Trading Demystified says commodity trading is about shifting commodities in time, space and form. In power, there is no form since electrons are electrons (well, ignoring fuel to power), there is some space (well assuming it flows according to a fixed grid topology/physical constraints) and almost no time (except storage). It is a commodity where microeconomics and auction theory dominates. 

## Key Intuitions

* Power is either PV (photovoltaic), chemical (battery) or spinning (steam/water/gas turbine).
* Power is priced by the contribution to grid reliability over a time interval. 
* The clearing auction is designed to quantify that value in monetary terms.
* Production is adjusted by tweaking various control systems on generators (actuators, valves, absorbing rods, bidirectional inverters) to maximize financial exposure to price.
* Load is adjusted by turning on more loads either in the time series or cross-section.


## Trading (Secondary Participants)

* Primary participants (gen/load) strongly prefer price stability/cash flow stability. This is similar to the Sharpe ratio but for prices.
* Secondary participants (traders) take on/swap the price risk and provide stability - price risk premia.
* Providing stable revenue/cost streams lets the market (both primary gen/load) develop - e.g project finance.
* The amount of EV/premia is net zero (good traders make +EV bets and bad traders make -EV bets), but the service provided is a net positive. Or at least that's what I want to believe. 




## Market Alphas

These alphas concern themself more with market participant behavior and (micro)economics. 

* Geography - Understanding geography of various country grids.
* Portfolio/Deals - Different portfolios and deals (PPA/offtakes/etc.) 
* Auctions - Understanding auction formats, clearing mechanisms.
* Supply Side - Understanding power plant microeconomics & bidding behavior in auction markets.
* Load Side  - Understanding the breakdown of load in terms of consumer behavior

## Technical Alphas

These alphas are related to basic understanding of introductory EE concepts at a qualitative level aka a 'YouTube' level. Some good channels: [Prof Mad](https://www.youtube.com/@Profmad), [Electrician U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCiVNAwErnQ)

* Electron Intuition - Drude model, water model
* Elementary circuits & Loads - Resistors, capacitors, inductors, parallel/series. 
* Load Technicals - Load adjustment (cross section, time series), load types
* Basic circuits - Inverters, rectifiers
* AC vs DC - Impedance, phasors, projection, power triangle, 3P AC, VAR
* Circuit Laws - KVL/KCL/Ohm/Power
* Flows Intuition - PTDF/linearization/superposition theorem
