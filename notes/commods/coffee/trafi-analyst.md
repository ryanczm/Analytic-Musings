# Chat with Trafigura Oil Analyst

This details my takeaways from a coffee chat with my friend, a Trafigura Oil Analyst. We met at APPEC in last September and stayed in contact. Lately, I've reached out to him for advice on self-starter commodity projects and ran through my two past projects for feedback (BP Stat Review + TMX), and he's been very kind to critique and advise me. We met in April for a chat. I'll try to respect his privacy and not disclose any details.

## Background

He's been at Trafigura for a couple years, going through the rotations in ops, risk and being a product market analyst, where he has been for a while. He's gone through the grinder at Trafigura and excelled there. Having been rejected by Trafi myself for a freight analyst role, it was a no-brainer to meet up.

I wanted to ask him more about how physical commodity trading works and to share his experiences at Trafigura, especially on _understanding markets_.

## On his Job

<!-- /TOC -->
> What is Physical Commodity Trading?

* Doing arbs. That's it.

> What does your role as a market analyst entail?
  
  * Look at things over many weeks and once in a while you have an idea. "Guys I think East-West is too strong and it's going to collapse".
  * I'll debate with them and work out. I'll look at the supply and demand picture.
  * What is demand for FO? 3 sources: feedstock demand (refinery processes like cracking to lighter fracs), power gen, bunker fuel for ships.
  * You have 50 different things and you have to weigh of all them together.
  * 99% of the time you are wrong and the market is right, 1% of the time there is a dislocation.
  * You don't get ideas very often. Maybe 6 times a year, once per 2 months. 

The key idea is _idea generation_. Which is the skill I want to learn. So how do you show it to employers given that you have no experience?

> What mix of quant vs qual are these models and ideas? Can you support it quant?

* There are some things you can quant and some things you can qual. For example, FO before 2020 is irrelevant because of IMO 2020.
* Russia happened. 2022. There are certain arbs that are open now but you can't backtest because you only have 2 years of data because the market changed.

IMO 2020 was a regulation that mandates a cap on sulfur emissions from fuel oil in ships. So this meant refineries would have to blend FO with lower sulfur, or ships can opt to have scrubbers, which remove sulphur oxide gas from exhaust gases, so they can continue to use heavy FO.  So it seems that due to alot of regime changes, you can't really look too far back into the historical data to 'backtest' or validate ideas. So it's really about understanding or how strong your logic is.

> What is a Refinery Margins Model? How does it work?

* Refineries run at certain rates. Indian refineries always put down lower than whatever is actual.
* You as a refinery making lot of money (margin), you should run more. There is an r/s between the two.
* But it isn't linear. It's a curve. So you want to fit margins to utilization to predict utilization.
* If you can see how much they run, this affects the demand.

----

> What is a Demand Model?

* Based on this and that and all my assumption, this will lead to an increase in market demand by 10%, but the market is pricing in 5%.
* Number crunching in excel. You need to have a figure out accurately quantities.
* And this is one of 50 different models. 

----

> What is shiptracking?

* You what to know how much crude or product is going to where, and then you estimate demand.
* One cargo of WTI from USGC to a refinery in SK. 
* Since ships are tracked on AIS, you can figure it out yourself. If it's a VLCC from US to East, you know it's WTI. It's obvious. And you have people on the ground that know what it carries.

## On Projects and Self-Starter Ideas


> Let's say I wanted to train this market analysis skill, I have no working exp. Anything you think I could do? Maybe spam the news and figure out something?

* I think what you're doing now is OK, look at the fellas thesis then write it out. But that's fine since you have no ideas.

> The problem with Big Orrin's stuff is that alot of data is not available. So I have to find what arguments have the most data then do it.


## On Market 'Sense'

He mentioned to me he follows refinery stuff on Twitter. So he knows there's is cargo coming out of this certain point, you know that refinery can only take this, so you know exactly where it is. Or a refinery fire happens here, you know exactly what it produces, where it ships to, what demand or supply will be affected, etc.

He then said once you look at the data enough, you kind of get a sensing of how it works. 

> So I guess when you get access to data, you can figure out stuff easily.

* Yes. Much easier.

## On Technicals as an Edge

You'd be surprised at how many analysts don't know refinery technicals. Majority of analysts don't even know the residual desulfurization unit doesn't just turn FO into LSFO, it gives you diesel and naphtha.

So my take is that you can give yourself an edge by with strong technical knowledge. And obviously this can work for any commods. E.g for oil, refinery technicals, for power, you have understanding power, grid, and weather technicals, for ags, you have understanding how crop cycles work, how weather impacts diff crops, etc.


# Conclusion

The key takeaways:

* The key skill or responsibility of a market analyst is to _form views based on data, in a discretionary fashion, by understanding the market_.
* This process can take a while, and brew over weeks.
* This skill is built by getting exposure to the real data then grinding it out.
* These views need to translate into arbs.
* Quantitative techniques might fail when there are drastic regime changes that render past data irrelevant.
* There is a _real edge/alpha over other analysts by having a deeper understanding of the technicals than they do_.

And some other stuff, which I don't want to share due to privacy reasons as mentioned above.
