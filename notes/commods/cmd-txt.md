# Overview

Very useful books. But as we all know, the real alpha is on $\mathbb{X}$ and not in books.

## Podcasts

* Everything - HC Commodities 
* Oil & Ags - Strong Source
* Shipping - Vonheim
* Power - Transmission (Modo), Energy Gang (WoodMac), Catalyst (Energy Impact Partners)


## Overall 

These cover different areas of commodities. 

* Geman - Commodities and Commodity Derivatives: Everything, but old, written in 08. New version please! Love the ags and metals section. Don't know if any other book covers so much breadth.
* Kaminski - Energy Markets: Only oil, gas and power. However, very USA-centric. Strong focus on domestic American gas and power. Author is ex-Enron ex-Citadel.
* Trafigura - Commodity Trading Demystified: Good for understanding the role of physical trading in the commodity supply chain.


## Oil

* Downey - Oil 101: A nice high level overview.
* Leffler - Non-technical Guides: More for pure technicals; refineries, pipelines, exploration, etc. Not so much markets.

## Gas

* Tusiana - LNG - A Non-Technical Guide: No complaints here. 

## Power

### Markets

* Glachant - Handbook on Electricity Markets: A high level in-depth overview of the history of markets.
* Kirschen - Fundamentals of Power System Economics: A very theoretical micro-economic approach. An example of nodal/congestion pricing I need to go through.

* Musgens - Energy Trading and Risk Management: A focus on the trading aspect of power from perspectives of various players in the ecosystem.
