# Overview

Very useful books. Not exhaustive but main ones I find useful. Problem - These are difficult without any prior knowledge! Some are easier on prior knowledge requirements (e.g. Kaminski). Imagine reading Geman or Glachant with no prior knowledge. Wallahi you're finished.

## Overall 

These cover different areas of commodities. 

* Geman - Commodities and Commodity Derivatives: Everything, but old, written in 08. New version please! Love the ags and metals section. Don't know if any other book covers so much breadth.
* Kaminski - Energy Markets: Only oil, gas and power.
* Trafigura - Commodity Trading Demystified: Good for understanding the role of physical trading in the commodity supply chain.


## Oil

* Downey - Oil 101
* Leffler - Non-technical Guides

## Gas

* Tusiana - LNG - A Non-Technical Guide

## Power

* Glachant - Handbook on Electricity Markets: A high level in-depth overview of the history of markets.
* Kirschen - Fundamentals of Power System Economics: A very theoretical micro-economic approach.
* Stoft - Power System Economics: A book on market and policy design.
