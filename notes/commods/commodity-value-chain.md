### Introduction

We can come up with a framework for thinking about commodity markets. From Craig Pirrong's 2015 _The Economics of Commodity Trading Firms_.  There exists a _commodity value chain_, and at each stage the commodity passes through the hands of various parties, all the way from beginning to end, where it is consumed.

At each step in the chain, the commodity undergoes a combination of logistical transformations: space (transportation), time (storage), form (processing), bringing it one step closer to consumption for utility. The invisible hand driving this movement is profit, at each stage, companies take profit by doing an arbitrage/transformation, buy $\rightarrow$ transform $\rightarrow$ sell The goal is maximize profitability by choosing the 'best' transformations (most profitable), by _processing new information and making decisions_. Making optimal choices from a set of possibilities given current information.

I suspect (physical) commodities lends itself more to discretionary modelling over statistical modelling because of how random events cannot be predicted by past data (e.g random shocks, like hurricanes, strikes, revolutions, geopolitics, etc). So it is more reactionary (e.g you hear news, you react and capitalize).

### Examples of Value Chains

The problem is, different commodities have different value chains (different journeys). The trick is to zoom in on one link at a time, and look at it from a _local perspective_.

Any single link can be viewed as supply $\rightarrow$ transformation $\rightarrow$ demand. The profit of the transformation is this determined by supply and demand. Then, we can identify 3 categories of players:

* Suppliers
* Arbitrageurs
* Buyers

### Supply & Demand Quantities/Factors

We can further split each supply or demand quantity into individual quantities in a hierarchical fashion, e.g based on geography (a natural grouping).

A possible hierarchy for quantities could look like this. A quantity would be measured by some variable: say demand/supply/imports/exports/inventory. 


Region (Q) $\rightarrow$ country (Q) $\rightarrow$ companies/players (Q) $\rightarrow$ production/consumption node (Q) $\rightarrow$ factors.

 
Then these quantities have _beta to individual factors_. These are latent drivers of quantities. For example, seasonality, weather, interest rates, OPEC policy, geopolitical events, etc. The problem is, while betas to these factors are probably estimable via statistical modelling, the factors themselves are suited to discretionary modelling, and by extension so are the quantities. For example, random shocks could occur (e.g political upheaval or natural disaster) that are not forecastable.

I'd like to come up with a nice diagram for this.

Generalizing further, we can view these as supply nodes and demand sinks and a normal state of flows (arb) that bring commodities over. Whenever factors change, they drive changes in supply/demand nodes, and the flows change accordingly.
