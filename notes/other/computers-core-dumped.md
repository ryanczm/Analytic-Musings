# Computing

Core Dumped is a nice YouTube channel covering low level computing  concepts in a simple way for laypeople like me. This is my thoughts from this video:

* The computer takes input from the human and produces the desired output. 
* CPU, memory, storage. Programs are loaded from storage into memory, and executed in sequential order.
* The CPU manipulates memory into the correct visual/audio output for us humans to consume.
