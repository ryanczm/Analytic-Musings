# Math and Programming

I saw this insightful tweet by the (possibly Singaporean) quant SystematicLS the other day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing I would like to point out here that I think is a salient point is that having theory reduces the search space.

I think this generalizes to a neat but obvious idea of math in programming. The search space of computation is infinite and unbounded. Math or theory in this case cuts a swift path in the space and forms a thread between a meaningful starting point and an end result.
