# Discretionary Modelling

Some thoughts on discretionary vs quantitative modelling. In both cases, you have some data or situation and want to deduce a likely outcome.

* **Central Problem**
  * Coming from ds background, I apply quantitative modelling. But I suspect nature of phys commods is that it favours discretionary.
  * Your features and target variables cannot be quantified as 'numbers'/tables in structured format. They are events or behaviors.
* **Modelling**
  * You have some data. You want to deduce or predict some future outcome based on the relationship between the data and outcome.
* **Discretionary Modelling**
  * You have some data, you want to see how it affects things. 
  * In quantitative modelling, you fit it to historical data.
  * In discretionary modelling, you look/map current situation to historical past data and outcomes. You reason out a likely outcome based on history. Your thesis.
  * E.g Ukraine war. Ok so when was the last EU conflict? Other conflicts? How were energy markets affected?
  * E.g Red sea attacks. Ok when were the last similar events? What happened then?
  * E.g tanker rates. Look at all historical events and see how rates reacted.
  * E.g OPEC policy. You look at past OPEC events and see how they behave.
  * You reason out based on as much relevant history as you can.
