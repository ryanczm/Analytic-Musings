# Data vs Memory

I was just thinking about this randomly one day. Quants or data scientists work with data. Programmers or developers or SWEs work with memory.

The job of the former is to extract insights/patterns/relationships/signals with the data that can be used. The job of the latter is to manipulate memory in a way that is useful to humans. 

This could be a useful heuristic to think about the role of programming in either type of job and how it's used. In the former type of roles, programming is merely a tool to do data analysis. In the latter, programming is the only tool that can manipulate memory.

And the idea is to get from the initial state of memory to the end state of memory as fast and efficiently as possible in the minimal number of steps/instructions using a fixed set of tools.
