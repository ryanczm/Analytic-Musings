## Overview

The demand for football is pretty high. Look at salaries. But I'm starting to believe there isn't much intellectual horsepower in it. Why? Probably because nerds don't like football. Well, there is the alpha/arbitrage here. All we need to do is gather data, run a few simple regressions and plot a couple of scatters. The current extent of football analytics is to look at pointless stats like pass completion, xG, all that nonsense.

Well the problem with all that is that context matters. Aka factor returns and idio returns. The classic example being a clinical striker always outperforming xG because by definition, he is clinical.

## Player Assessment

Optimal physical metrics per position (arm movement, touch density, leg to torso, torso uprightness)

* Idea - Can we measure the physical movements of a player and tell us how good he is? 
* Applications - Scouting/development
* Data - Physical measurements of players.

## Transfers

Predicting transfer adaptability cross-league. 

* Idea - Can we see how well cross-league transfers generalizes (aka can he do it in a cold windy night in Stoke?) across different leagues? Aka predicting success vs flops.
* Applications - Transfers
* Data - Transfer data and a metric of performance.

## Managers

Quantifying manager performance. We know managers have alpha and beta. Alpha being their idio return and beta being their factor returns (current squad, budget, support). Unfortunately, football fans are not too good at distinguishing alpha from beta.

* Idea - You can find out undervalued managers by those with really poor factor return but super high idio return. 
* Applications - Judging managers, manager transfers
* Data - Standard stuff.
