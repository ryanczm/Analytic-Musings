## Rationale

I decided to make a webpage to act as both a portfolio to demonstrate some of my projects, as well as a 'scientific blog' to informally log what I have been thinking about.

## Content

Posts adapted from take-home technical projects and my own musings. 

Projects are on the main page. Notes are my thoughts.
