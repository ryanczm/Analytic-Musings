## Rationale

I decided to make a webpage to act as both a portfolio to demonstrate some of my projects, as well as a 'scientific blog' to informally log what I have been thinking about.

## Content

Posts adapted from take-home technical projects and my own musings.

## Theme

The site is built from Ruby's [Hyde/Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/hyde). I recently migrated over to Ruby from a hacky, manually made static site (writing HTML and CSS is cumbersome).

Using markdown to write posts is more intuitive which is something Jekyll lets you do.

This idea to Jekyll migration was copied (with permission) from one of the smartest people I know, who also uses Jekyll for his academic blog.
