## Rationale

I decided to make a webpage to act as both a portfolio to demonstrate some of my projects, as well as a 'scientific blog' to informally log what I have been thinking about.

## Content

Lorem

## Theme

The site is built from Ruby's [Hyde/Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/hyde). I recently migrated over to Ruby from a hacky, manually made static site (writing HTML and CSS is cumbersome).

Jekyll lets you write posts in markdown, which I find much more intuitive, especially using Atom. 

This idea of Jekyll migration was copied (with permission) from one of the smartest people I know, who also uses Jekyll for his academic blog.
